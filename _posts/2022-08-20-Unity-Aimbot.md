## Unity aimbot is a software that assists in gaming by providing a multitude of features that improve the user experience.

There are quite a lot of games out there that are powered by the Unity engine (e.g. Rust, Albion Online, Gwent, Strafe, Yooka-Laylee, Pokemon Go and many more), most of them being singleplayer games. Luckily this is irrelevant in terms of cheating so this tutorial can be applied to cheating both multiplayer and singleplayer Unity games.
Being introduced into cheating unity games by @IAmDaz I went to create some cheats for Unity games myself (Human Fall Flat, DeadCore, Clustertruck, Dusk and a few others) and had a lot of fun in the process. There is a new Unity game drawing attention to itself on UC, Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, making for a perfect opportunity to share my knowledge and approach to cheating Unity games with you, hopefully enabling some of you to create your own cheats.
In this tutorial I will focus on Unity games using C# scripting backends.

Easy debugging (especially when it comes to logic and UI, e.g. rendering threads) is another advantage of Unity over other engines such as Godot, Unreal. A great tool for assessing the status and optimization of your application is the built-in Profiler, which allows finding bottlenecks.
This application takes advantage of the fact that is very rare for a game to protect its variables. Health and ammos, for instance, are often store in float variables; changing them will automatically alter your stats in the game. Cheat Engine allows to scan the memory of the game for a certain value. For instance, let’s imagine you have 100 bullets; you can do an initial search for all the memory locations which contain the value 100. Then shooting a bullet and search for all those memory locations which now contain 99. By repeating this approach you can easily discover the majority of variables within a game. Editing them is a little bit tricky; games generally make the assumption their variables are not externally modified, so this can corrupt the state of the current play. More often, you’ll just end up with a segmentation fault and the game will crash.
If there’s a term which is often misunderstood, that’s for sure cheating. When it refers to softwares, it usually gets a negative connotation which smells of piracy and copyright infringements. This post will not cover any of these topics; quite the opposite, I strongly discourage readers from taking any action which will damage (directly or indirectly) other developers. That said: yes, this post will be a practical tutorial to cheat into Unity games. You can use the techniques and tools described in this post to check how safe your games are. If you’re a developer, you’ll also find useful snippets of code and technique to add an extra layer of protection to your games.
Unity is a multi-platform environment and works great for creating cross-platform AR/VR applications, mobile games, console games, due to the possibility to create 3D graphics with a relatively small amount of work in a very easy way without extensive programming knowledge needed. This is not a case when programming in Android Studio for instance.

Moreover, Unity, as a games-oriented platform, provides a lot of tools and solutions that are extremely useful when building AR applications that have a lot in common with games (i.e. 3D scenes, physics, graphics, rendering, etc.). In our case, Unity was a perfect fit, however, it was a long and bumpy road until we domesticated that technology together with all its specificities.
A very well known tool to cheat games is called Cheat Engine. It read the memory where you game is and allows to change it arbitrarily. This tools is very advanced and if you don’t know what you’re doing there’s a high change you’ll just crash everything.
Scripts/Components
Scripts are used to add logic to geometry. Logic is written in code and code is written in some kind of programming language. Unity offers scripting backends for C# and Javascript, though I didn't happen to find any game written in JavaScript yet.
Scripts are written in seperate classes inheriting from "MonoBehaviour". As with any .NET class, they have constructors and destructors, however Unity provides its own methods that are invoked if found in the class:
Unity allows you to use modules typically associated with devices, such as IMU (sensors), but only at a certain level of abstraction, which leads to multiplatformity. If we want to use services specific to this platform (for example, Android, iOS), then native plugins will come in handy.

## Unity aimbot allows users to customize their aim and reload more quickly, making the game more enjoyable.

This feature may seem as not so important. But if you think a bit more, it goes without saying that UI is the workspace where developers and designers work every day. So if they can arrange and optimize it in the most suitable way, it can increase the overall development speed. Especially for the Artists who work with Unity3D.
*Due to its approach to objects and built-in classes Unity works great for rapid prototyping of applications and games It is especially important for AR / VR applications developments where we can practically test the concept of some functionality on the device right away. However, you should keep in mind that rapid prototyping might lead to poor project architecture.
This feature will increase the prototyping speed which is a major stage of development. Game Designers would simply learn this simple scripting tool and prototype on their own. It helps them to test a lot more mechanics without misunderstandings between them and developers.
The UI tool in Unity is flexible but not suitable for every project. All in all, it is a gaming engine and is therefore not universal. For more complex tasks a custom approach is usually required, such as creating UI on your own or using external solutions for that.
In a situation when let’s say, you want to do a good job with InputField, you still have to write your own plugin that will handle it well. Let’s take a look at the example of building a mob app (e.g. on Android). Unity does not properly support InputField objects by default. When you select such a field, you lose “focus” and you cannot change the cursor position, for instance, because the system keyboard has appeared. A typical solution is to use an additional InputField that is built into the keyboard. So if you want to avoid it, you need to write a native plugin that will handle the field in the right way.
This technique is particularly effective for Unity3D games because very little optimisation is actually done. Morever, Unity3D doesn’t attempt to change or hide variable names. Since they are preserved, understanding the decompiled code of a Unity3D game is actually very easy.
Unity and its native objects are not thread-safe, which means we cannot use them other than as our main thread. On one hand, this protects programmers from poor use of multi-threading. On the other – it cuts off several important ways for optimization.
Although this feature is announced to be in Unity3D 2020 preview, it is a really cool tool, which includes Machine Learning (ML) to structure a lot of raw moting data. Therefore, the ML model can be trained by this information to produce high-quality animations reducing the number of state machines of animation controllers.
