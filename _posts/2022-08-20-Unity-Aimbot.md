## Find unity bugs with a bug detector.

To make bug reporting as quick as possible, we made a bug reporting application for you. When running Unity choose Help-Report a Bug in the menu, or you can access it directly through the executable in the directory where Unity is installed. It will also launch automatically if you experience a crash.

When your bug is submitted, you will receive an automatic confirmation email. Each email will include a hyperlink to a web page that contains the current status of the issue. You can check this link at any time. We cannot personally email back every person about every bug report, so please check the status of your issue if you are curious. Generally, all fixes will be rolled out in the next major or minor update to Unity. Keep an eye out for fixes when the new version is released!
GetComponent/FindObject
Unity provides two functions that are very useful for gamecheating: "GameObject.FindObjectsOfType" and "GameObject.GetComponent".
- static T GameObject GameObject.FindObject() will iterate through all instantiated GameObjects and return Components of the specified type.
- T GameObject.GetComponent() (and its derivatives) will search for the Components of the given type in the GameObject you called this on.
Use those functions with caution though: they take a long time to finish and can decrease your FPS drastically if used too frequently.
Last, compile this code and copy the 'TestMod.dll' file to the 'Info.json' file. After starting the game, you will see messages in the 'Log.txt' file. Also detailed log can be found in 'YourGame\YourGame_Data\output_log.txt' or 'c:\Users%USERNAME%\AppData\LocalLow\YourGame\output_log.txt'.
Burst: Temporarily removed the Burst compiler warning about exception throws not in [Conditional("ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS")] methods, to let us address user feedback. The next minor version of Burst will reincorporate this in a more friendly manner.

Here's a screenshot I attached to the wrong bug:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-2d/+bug/757652/+attachment/2090480/+files/Unity%203D%20-%203%20monitor%20setup%20with%20output%200%20as%20leftmost%20display.png It's badly named, should say rightmost display. I worked around it by switching my monitor outputs, which sucks as a general solution but worked in my case
By navigating through the assembly you can select a class and inspect their code by simply selecting a method (e.g. "Gun.Shoot" in Totally Accurate Battlegrounds):[dnSpy-View-CSharp.png]
I suggest to look for promising classnames such as "Player", "Game", "Weapon", "Rifle", "Grenade" or the names of any items/weapons you can get ingame (e.g. "GrapplingHook" in Clustertruck).
UI Toolkit: Fixed scrollView's showHorizontal and showVertical limitations. They are converted to a tristate enum, horizontalScrollerVisibility and verticalScrollerVisibility, to support a new Hidden state, along with AlwaysVisible and Auto.

Open the project creation and select 'Class Library (NET Framework)'. Change name to 'TestMod'. Open the project properties and target platform should be 'Net Framework 3.5' or 'Net Framework 4.0' for the newer Unity version. If game is made for .net 3.5, UMM must be installed as Doorstop method.

## Use a unity aimbot to cheat in games.

CheatEngine is a well known game-cheating tool, which I keep discovering more and more functionality in. While it's most obvious use case is "memory scanning" (eg: to find the memory address of a "health" value in memory, allowing you to set or freeze it) it also has some great support for Mono apps/games (like those written in Unity). When installing just watch out for toolbars or other crapware it may try and get you to install.
SunbeamAdded GodMode, RefillPlayerHealth and TriggerMissionFailure. See hotkeys below (they can be changed, if you want):Have fun Smile[ 19.10.2015 - Update #Hello everyone.In the fashion of Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag Cheat Handler, presenting to you the x64 version for Assassin's Creed: Unity.How it works:1. Launch the game and get to main menu screen.2. Alt-tab out to Cheat Engine.3. Load ACU.ct table, select ACU.exe process and enable (click the check box in front of it) [Enable] script.4.a. If it activates, then enable HookWithHWBreakpoint script.4.b. If it doesn't activate, let me know - the same for above mentioned script.5. Now either activate last script, Cheat Handler or load game, then activate it.Explanations:There is a function that contains the entire debug menu the engine (this game) works with. '[Enable]' script finds certain locations in memory and then registers the symbols of these addresses. The 'HookWithHWBreakpoint' script then gets the addresses of the storage pointer and the hook address, and places a hardware breakpoint at that location (pContext). LUA helps setting a condition when breakpoint is hit, such as retrieving RCX pointer I need to then call up on game's debug menu functions WinkFor now, I've only added 2 functions:- ToggleVanish (use Numpad 0 hotkey)- RefillAllEquipment (use Numpad 1 hotkey)First one above is toggleable (on/off) with same hotkey. Second function will just refill your inventory, so you don't have to parkour all the way to a medic.Will be adding more next week, upon my return from Amalfi Smile Also, a teleporter with two more hardware breakpoints WinkNotes:1. If any of the scripts don't get enabled, let me know.2. If game crashes when enabling the Cheat Handler, you'll probably have to restart the game (did happen to me a few times).3. Note the pContext pointer is acquired/updated in these situations:- when you load game for the first time, entering game world;- when you teleport from one viewpoint to another;- when you start a mission;- any other time when a cutscene plays (not everytime);So, see to it that 'pContext' address in the table (under HookWithHWBreakpoint, once enabled) contains a valid pointer (not '??' or '00000000').4. To refresh pContect, you can fast travel (just to make sure address is acquired).5. If pressing Numpad 0 or 1 doesn't do anything, wait a bit or move around and try pressing again. It should work eventually after 1-2 presses.Have fun![ 25.03.Began looking at this title as well, along with Rogue. They're using same AnvilNEXT Engine ported to x64. Fun fact about this one is the excessive (yet irrelevant) use of VMProtect to envelope game code.Running the game and dumping it, then studying the unpacked code (to also be read as uncompressed, since VMProtect packed data here) returns the following:
There are quite a lot of games out there that are powered by the Unity engine (e.g. Rust, Albion Online, Gwent, Strafe, Yooka-Laylee, Pokemon Go and many more), most of them being singleplayer games. Luckily this is irrelevant in terms of cheating so this tutorial can be applied to cheating both multiplayer and singleplayer Unity games.
Being introduced into cheating unity games by @IAmDaz I went to create some cheats for Unity games myself (Human Fall Flat, DeadCore, Clustertruck, Dusk and a few others) and had a lot of fun in the process. There is a new Unity game drawing attention to itself on UC, Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, making for a perfect opportunity to share my knowledge and approach to cheating Unity games with you, hopefully enabling some of you to create your own cheats.
In this tutorial I will focus on Unity games using C# scripting backends.
What now?
Well now it's up to you to use this knowledge, get to know your favourite Unity game better and cheat the shit out of it.
Don't hesitate to ask in case you have any questions left unanswered, I'll try my best to answer them. Also, any kind of feedback is greatly appreciated!
Injecting custom scripts
Editing is powerful but it has its limits - Implementing new functionality is perfectly possible but incredibly inconventient when quickly prototyping stuff. For this (and eventually for cleaner code) you may want to write your own scripts and inject them into the game.
You will want to create two classes:
These methods involve making changes to the game's "Assembly-CSharp.dll" file in order for the cheats to work - it's probably a good idea to back up this file before doing any of the below. These modifications should persist through different instances of the games unless Steam updates or repairs the game files.
Then you can compile your project, grab any mono-injector (simply google for one, make sure you get one for the same processor architecture your game uses) and make it inject your compiled script (DLL) into the game passing parameters like the namespace, class and method that instantiates your cheat.
In addition to what Zat said, if I may add:1. You can also use ReflexIL to add a call the Load method of your cheat to Assembly-CSharp.dll if you are having a hard trouble injecting although this will only work if there's no anti-cheat.2. Combining Labels, TextFields and Buttons allows for an interactive cheat design (Ask user Player name to kill, or Player name to teleport to for example).3. If FindObjectsOfType doesn't return any objects despite you think that you are looking at the correct class, this may work instead.
