## Macos aiming is a complex process.

Phew, that was a pretty long post which covered some topics to help you get started with game cheating on macOS. This is certainly not a comprehensive article about game cheating and I possibly may have done things in a very dumb way. Please correct me if I’m wrong. There might be errors in the code above and if you can improve it, please file an issue or submit a PR to the git project at https://github.com/jaiverma/headshot.

An aimbot will automatically aim at enemy players, so all we have to do is move around and press the left mouse button to kill an enemy. To achieve this, we need to calculate the yaw and pitch angles from our player to the enemy player so we can programmatically adjust our aim.
If you looked closely at this video, you’ll notice that our aimbot sucks. Yes we can lock onto enemy players and shoot them with ease, but we’re still locking onto players which aren’t in our field of vision. This is really annoying because it makes it really difficult to navigate the map if you’re locked onto something which is moving around.
Easy as that! Now you’ll never miss an update on your Mac. You can also check Apple’s support guide about enabling updates, which may differ a little depending on the macOS version you are using. (Get the steps to enable auto-updates on a Windows 10 system here.)
Anyone who has played an online shooter game in the past two or three decades has almost certainly come across a person or machine that cheats at the game by auto-aiming. For newer games with anti-cheat, this is less of a problem, but older games like Team Fortress have been effectively ruined by these aimbots. These types of cheats are usually done in software, though, and [Kamal] wondered if he would be able to build an aim bot that works directly on the hardware instead.

Oblivity is fully customizable! You can adjust anything to create your perfect, individual aim training experience. To name some examples: Change any ingame colour, create your own crosshair, import your own sound effects and customize the ingame HUD. Of course you can also set all technical values. Oblivity supports different FOV types, each keybind can be changed, different monitor resolutions and aspect ratios are supported.
You’d need an XY plotter gantry to do this on a phone or tablet. Or, you could run it in Windows using an emulator.
Either way, you’d need an option to deliberately *NOT* hit exact centre, both for deliberate hooks / slices and to help evade detection.
Note macOS proxy settings are not universal; apps and services may not honor system proxy settings. Ensure the application you wish to proxy is correctly configured and manually verify connections don't leak. Additionally, it may be possible to configure the pf firewall to transparently proxy all traffic.
Over time, the rhythm of our lives forces you to cut corners and break the serene patterns we set out to uphold. Truth is few of us have the discipline, or frankly desire, to review all the changes on our Macs every week and place everything where “it should be.”

## A mac aiming algorithm.

To find a memory address, such as the current ammo, we can follow a process of minimisation. We will start with some amount of ammo and search for that value with the help of our defined functions. We can then change the ammo value again by shooting some bullets and then search again for this new value but only in the subset of memory locations we found in the last search.
First, we’ll remind everyone frustrated with the state of games like TF2 that this is a proof-of-concept robot that is unlikely to make any aimbots worse or more common in any games. This is mostly because [Kamal] is training his machine to work in Aim Lab, a first-person shooter training simulation, and not in a real multiplayer videogame. The robot works by taking a screenshot of his computer in Python and passing the information through a computer vision algorithm which recognizes high-contrast targets. From there a PID controller is used to tell a series of omniwheels attached to the mouse where to point, and when the cursor is in the hitbox a mouse click is triggered.
To effectively search for arbitrary patterns in memory, we need to search for our needle in a preformatted way according to how the memory is stored for a certain architecture specification. In x86, data is stored in little endian format and also, a pointer is of size 4 bytes on x86. The Assault Cube release comes on in x86 (32 bit) and doesn’t offer a 64 bit version for macOS. To use the helper functions we’ve defined above, we thus need to format our queried pattern accordingly.
I urge you to try this trainer out and improve upon it. The aimbot is extremely jerky and a lot of enhancements can be make. Try patching the recoil function so that the aimbot is even more accurate. I also haven’t added functionality to distinguish between players on my team vs players on the enemy team. This trainer currently doesn’t stand a chance to go undetected by any of the anti-cheat solutions. Try to improve this so that it can bypass anti-cheat!
Every run can be rewatched with the replay tool. The timeline shows, where you did which mistake. Be it over- undershooting the deviation or your overall performance. The playback speed can be adjusted to any level. You can also turn on onscreen indicators that show your aim line compared to the optimal aiming path.
We need to improve this. FPS games usually implement a function which traces a line from our gun to the enemy player to check whether the line intersects with any other object on its way to the player. Basically for checking whether our bullet will hit the enemy or will it hit some object in between, like a wall.
The Spotlight search Mac feature has been integral to every macOS for years. Easily launched with a simple shortcut of ⌘ + Space, Spotlight Mac will search your Finder, calculate anything you can think of, show you the weather forecast, define obscure words, and more. In terms of features for Alfred vs Spotlight, Spotlight probably gets you about 70% there. So unless there’s something specific you like about Alfred (e.g. the ability to execute custom commands), you might be better off just staying with the Spotlight Mac search.
