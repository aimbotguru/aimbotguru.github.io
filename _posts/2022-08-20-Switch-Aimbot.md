## The switch aimbot is a simple and cheap way to improve your aim in fps games.

Playing Fortnite on the Switch can be a bit difficult especially for those that aren’t familiar with playing shooting games with a controller. Thankfully, the game has an aim assist function for those that use consoles. In this article, we’ll show you how to adjust auto aim in Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch.

Playing shooting games with a controller isn’t as easy as compared to using a keyboard and mouse. As Fortnite allows users from different platforms to play together, this sets people using controllers at a disadvantage. Auto aim, or aim assist is the developer’s way to try and close that performance gap.
The adjustments of the controls as given above usually determine how well the aim assist performs. Properly adjusted aim assist settings allow it to function as if you’re actually using auto aim. Here’s a sample of some of the best settings you can use, though you can adjust them as you see fit:
Keep in mind that using game cheats, aimbots, wallcheats and other such software that are detected can cause your Switch (Hardware ID) to get banned from Nintendos online services, which includes online matchmaking for a lot of game. Be careful especially when trying to cheat online multiplayer games!
The console version of this cheat is great because, unlike a computer that takes time to aim properly as well as hold down buttons on the keyboard or mouse, all one has to do is press some buttons on their gamepad while aiming in order to instantly take out opponents without even having any type of skill whatsoever. If you see a Fortnite cheats free download stay away it will get your account banned.

PC Systems: You can purchase various PC aimbots for Fortnite online. We suggest you visit Elite PVPers Fortnite Black Market as they have a shop section with user reviews. The current cheat with the most views and least amount of bans comes from Disrupt and includes a rage cheat.
Console systems: Purchase the Cronus Zen from CronusMax. This device allows you to use the aimbot esp, no recoil, and more in Fortnite without having to worry about a ban. You can see videos and more on the Cronus Zen website. Radar cheats won’t work on console systems and neither will a speedcheat, spinbot, noclip, fly, or aimlock.
Mobile Phones IOS and Android: Android cheaters have a Mod APK for Fortnite that is supposed to include Unlimited V-Bucks and Auto-Aim but we haven’t tested this release. We don’t suggest you use esp aimbot on IOS because you have to jailbreak the phone.
