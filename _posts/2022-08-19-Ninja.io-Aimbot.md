They are just enabling you to cheat your way into doing something, not cheating. Kahoot is designed using Javascript and PHP, and I will not be telling you any workarounds for this. Third-party software and tools can help you achieve your target here, and the best way to do it is by using a Kahoot Hack Chrome Extension.
I'm having the same problem. I have both the standalone player and the Chrome extension, and can run the demo at https://www.getsupernova.com/demo/. The extension appears on kongregate.com, but clicking either option has no effect. I can't find anyway to run the standalone player. I'm running on Windows 10.
Note: Since Smartphones do not have the same settings option, and they vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, hence ensure the correct settings before changing any. Samsung Galaxy A21 s is used to explain the process in this article and may differ on your phone according to the manufacturer.
We have an internal alpha version for MacOS which works well (about the same as the Windows version). However, we have not completed the full MacOS feature set required for release (security features, browser integration, etc) due to limited adoption/usage of the Windows version of Supernova Player to date. We'll see what happens on Jan 12th and if usage justifies the completion and release of the MacOS version. Not sure that a ChromeOS version is possible at this time, sorry.
It appears that McAfee (and perhaps some other security companies) consider Supernova's implementation in breach of security standards and therefore have blocked Supernova as a trojan horse application. If you have antivirus or malware detection software enabled, Supernova will not work. Somebody at Supernova need to get to work and fix their implementation to become standards compliant.
