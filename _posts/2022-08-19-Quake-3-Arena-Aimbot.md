## How to use a quake 3 arena aimbot.

Now, theres some mad math behind all the required calculations. In short, you need a world to screen function, which transforms the 3D coordinates of the game world into 2D coordinates you can actually use to make the aimbot work in combination with mouse events. Most likely your screen only has two dimensions, the game has three – hence the transformation. Also, it allows to check if an entity is present in the current field of view. The people at GuidedHacking have a very good explanation of what’s going on in detail, so I recommend checking out this article.

In Quake III Arena, the player must go through Arena Eternal, defeating the six tiers made up of five bots each. There is a 0th and 7th Tier either side of the six. Tier 0 is a tutorial where the player gets used to the game whilst fighting the introductional weakest bot in the game. Once the player defeats the sixth tier, they will then face the lord of Arena Eternal in the Final Tier. This is the page on the default bots of Quake III Arena. Those marked with 'AL', are Arena Lords.

You can use additional characters, maps and mods designed for the original Quake 3 Arena inside OpenArena. But some of them could have some problems, for example caused by missing textures, missing maps or missing bots. Please refer to ModCompat page for additional info. In general, mods designed for Q3A v1.27 or later should work. Also, you can refer to MapCompat for a long list of Q3 maps tested (or still to be tested) with OA.
Additional player models should be complete models (usually, those in pk3 files larger than 1 MB), not simply additional skins (different textures) for existing Quake 3 characters.
The idea is to continuously focus on an enemy entity in case the aim key, for example the left CTRL key, is being held down. As soon as an enemy is present in the crosshair, the aimbot will therefore lock the view on the respective entity on the screen.

The proxy can optionally rewrite some of the client packets and modify the direction in which the player is looking to make them aim at an enemy. It will do this when the player is pressing the fire button and the currently selected weapon is the machinegun, the shotgun, the lightning gun or the railgun. It will choose the enemy that’s closest to the crosshairs (it will happily shoot at teammates). Optionally it will restrict the aiming to enemies within a configured angular diameter around the crosshairs.
UPDATE: Checked again at the end of May 2016... it looks like id Software/Bethesda fixed the DNS problem. Quake 3 Arena master server works! So the workaround described here below is no more needed. If you applied it, probably you can remove the workaround from your .hosts file, to have it dynamic again.
Quake 3 Arena is the pinnacle of multiplayer 3D deathmatch. Welcome to the Arena, where high-ranking warriors are transformed into spineless mush. Abandoning every ounce of common sense and any trace of doubt, you lunge onto a stage of harrowing landscapes and veiled abysses. Your new...
Quake III Launcher is a small program that simply quits the Finder, and then launches Quake III Arena instead. By doing this, you are freeing up much needed RAM that would otherwise be used by OS X, and therefore letting Quake run faster and smoother.To re-boot the Finder, simply press the...

## How to undetect a quake 3 arena aimbot.

I don’t want to be treated like this and I’ve found a reliable way to prevent it. The cheat needs to detect if the local players is being gripped, aim at the last attacker and perform a force push, which breaks the grip. Since the aimbot is already implemented, only a few addtional things are needed:
// If we are currently being gripped
if (ps && (ps-fd.forceGripBeingGripped || ps-fd.forceGripCripple)) {
auto ent = entFromClientNum(ps-persistant[PERS_ATTACKER])
// focus the current target, similar to the aimbot functionality focusEnt(pCurPushTarget); syscall_hook(CG_SENDCONSOLECOMMAND, "force_throw;");
}
Get the entity of our last attacker: Luckily, the client number of our last attacker is stored in the persistant[PERS_ATTACKER] field of the playerState structure. Every entity has a field which maps it to a specific client number, so a simple loop will determine the correct entity

Hook the GetProcAddress() function of the game process. This function is being used to retrieve addresses from DLL exports. It’s being called as soon as the game starts. Using this hook we can replace calls to vmMain() and dllEntry() with our own implementations.
For server admins, probably this can be workarounded just by sending "heartbeats" to more master servers, e.g. settingsv_master2 to master3.idsoftware.com... but for clients, it looks like master server address is hard-coded, so the workaround requires to edit one's "hosts." file to trick the client into querying a different master server:
World War II rages and nations fall. SS head Himmler has Hitler's full backing to twist science and the occult into an army capable of annihilating the Allies once and for all. Battling alone, you're on an intense mission to pierce the black heart of the Third Reich and stop Himmler -- or die trying.
The easiest way to convince our game to show the hidden player entity nevertheless is the following: There’s another force power, force sight, which enables players to see invisible players. We just tell the game that we have already activated this force power:
