## Rust is an open source programming language that is language-independent, meaning that it can be used to create software that runs on a wide range of platforms, including desktop and mobile devices.

Rust is a statically-typed programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency and memory management. Its syntax is similar to that of C++. It is an open-source project developed originally at Mozilla Research. In 2021, the Rust Foundation has taken the torch and is driving the development of the language.

Rust can be defined as a multi-paradigm and general-purposecomputer programming language. Statically typed, Rust provides a fast, reliable, highly productive and memory efficient software programming environment. It is ideal for powering performance-critical services, able to run on embedded devices and it is very easy to integrate with various other programming languages.
Rust is a multiparadigm general-purpose programming language introduced by Graydon Hoare from Mozilla Research. Rust is focused on safety, stability, and performance. It is a statically typed programming language with a memory-efficient architecture and is C/C++ compliant.
Low Cost: If it’s an open-source language, then it’s free of charge. With limited resources being the norm for businesses of all sizes, Rust is a resource-efficient programming language that enables programming for complex embedded systems – found almost anywhere from household central heating, car engine management systems, dishwashers, as well as TVs and smartphones.
Rust is an ahead-of-time compilation language. In other words, we compile a Rust program and hand over the executable to another person to run it on their system. Since it is already an executable, the other person can run it on their system without even installing Rust.

Introduced in 2010, Rust was created at Mozilla Research as a more reliable, safer alternative to C++. Rust is a static multiparadigm, memory-efficient programming language, focused on speed, security, and performance. It is used to develop game engines, file systems, websites and tools, operating systems, browser components, and much more. Rust Foundation, an independent organization, now manages the open source code base.
Open-Source: While Rust is an open-source project with an abundance of learning resources, and originally developed at Mozilla Research as mentioned above, by 2021, the Rust Foundation is responsible for supporting the maintenance and driving the development of this language.
Programming languages come and go; while some create hype, some just vanish away. We all know it is tough to penetrate the developers’ core area and influence them, and when it comes to programming languages, they are very picky. Well, Rust as a programming language is doing everything it can to win the hearts of developers.
Cross-Platform: Coding flexibility is an advantage that is highly valued by software developers, and Rust can certainly deliver plenty of it. By enabling easy cross-platform development, Rust helps developers to establish robust and powerful performance across multiple applications.

## One of the features of rust is its console, which allows developers to enter code and execute it immediately.

Also, as an open source project, Rust has developers who have optimized and smoothed out the user experience. For example, the compiler generates very accurate and particularly instructive error messages to help the users; it even highlights offending code and also recommends how to fix it.
In Rust also, there is no garbage collection. Instead, the developers have complete control over low-level details such as storing data on the heap or the stack. This makes Rust suitable for building libraries for other programming languages. You could technically replace performance critical parts of a software with high-performance Rust code.
Memory Management: Manually managing memory in languages like C can be tedious and time-consuming. With low-level memory control needed for system programming, Rust has access to both hardware and memory because it does not require a garbage collector to run continuously in the background. You are free to replace code without risking memory safety.
Concurrent Programming: Rust makes it easy to program concurrent software because it prevents data races during compiling time. Data races can cause problems when at least two different processes are trying to access the same computer memory location at the same time.
In Rust there are two modes of writing code: Safe Rust and Unsafe Rust. Safe Rust imposes additional restrictions on the programmer (e.g. object ownership management), thereby ensuring that the code works properly. Unsafe Rust gives the programmer more autonomy (e.g. it can operate on raw C-like pointers), but the code may break.
Moreover, this option clears out data without the need for the program to decide on allocating and cleaning memory. Rust can be easily integrated with other languages without adversely affecting them as it eliminates the need to run a garbage collector constantly.
The Rust community also provides thorough documentation and immediate online help. Not just the tooling but infrastructure around Rust is commendable. Unlike many other programming languages, where you need to use many compilers, Rust can be used with ease by having a single tool, named Cargo, to compile the code, run tests, generate documentation, and upload a package to a repository and much more.
Also, for developers not used to working with a language where errors in the code are detected at compile time, it may be annoying to get many error messages. As a result, developing code is not as fast as in more popular languages, like Python. However, Rust’s developers are doing their best to make these error messages as informative and actionable as possible.
