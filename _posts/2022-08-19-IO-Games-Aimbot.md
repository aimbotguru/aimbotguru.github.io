## Io games are one of the most popular genres on steam.

If you like dinosaurs, survival games and base-building mechanics then ARK: Survival Evolved is the game for you. Despite its issues ranging from lag to bugged gameplay, the game has a high player count on Steam. The game peaked with over 150,000 concurrent players on Steam earlier this year, and it continues to draw more than 60,000 players every day.

There are different types of racing games that the player competes against time or opponents using some means of transportation. Sub-genres include racing simulators (Gran Turismo) and kart racing (Mario Kart). Other racing simulator series like Forza are one of the most popular game in this category, but arcade classics like Pole Position are included here too.
Considered by many as one of the best single-player games on PC, Rockstar Games’ Grand Theft Auto V is another popular game in the Steam library. The game draws more than 120,000 concurrent players at any given day and with updates for the PS5 and Xbox Series X already announced, the game will only continue to attract more players.
With 84% positive feedback out of the 379,311 user reviews on Steam, Rust is one of the best games on Steam. Rust is a first-person, open-world, massively-multiplayer survival game by Facepunch Studios that will endear to players who want a mix of survival and crafting. Drawing in about 70,000 players every day, Rust is another Steam game that keeps on churning high player counts and all things considered, it seems the game isn’t dead but thriving.
Racing games typically place the player in the driver's seat of a high-performance vehicle and require the player to race against other drivers or sometimes just time. This genre of games is one of the staples of the computer gaming world and many of the earliest computer games created were part of this genre. Emerging in the late 1970s, this genre is still very popular today and continues to push the envelope in terms of graphics and performance. These games "tend to fall into organized racing and imaginary racing categories". Organized racing simulators attempt to "reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class: Indycar, NASCAR, Formula 1, and so on." On the other hand, imaginary racing games involve "imaginary situations, driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments". These "imaginary" racing games are sometimes called arcade racing games, in contrast to their more realistic "racing simulation" counterparts. These include Need For Speed, Mario Kart and Gran Turismo. Rollings and Adams note that "racing games are often sold in the sports category," but "from a design standpoint, they really belong in ... vehicle simulations".

This online tactical shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal still continues to be one of the most played games on Steam. Released in 2015, the game is still making records with Ubisoft announcing earlier this year that the game has over 60 million registered players across platforms. The game also hit its record peak high of more than 198,567 concurrent players on steam just on March this year, according to the data from steam charts. With Ubisoft announcing plans for PlayStation 5 and Xbox series X/S and cross-platform play, the numbers may only go higher in the coming months.
Horror games are games that incorporate elements of horror fiction into their narrative, generally irrespective of the type of gameplay. It is the only major video game genre that is recognized by narrative elements rather than by gameplay, gameplay mode, or platform. Survival horror is a subgenre of horror games focused on action-adventure style of gameplay.
Genres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called subgenres. For example, an action game can be classified into many subgenres such as platform games and fighting games. Some games, most notably browser and mobile games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.
Sandbox and open-world games are not specifically video game genres, as they generally describe gameplay features, but often games will be described as a sandbox or an open-world game as if it were a defining genre. They are included here for such distinguishing purposes.

## Io games are vulnerable to cheat programs.

Major online games have anti-cheat systems, but it's perhaps time to augment these with some lessons from the broader security industry. Many organisations run bug bounty schemes, encouraging white-hat cheaters to find vulnerabilities in their software in return for a financial reward.
It's also worth remembering that cheats are against the user agreement of many popular games to modify the code of the game in order to gain an advantage and game developers are going to frown upon those to develop cheats. Because of this, developing and distributing cheats can be against the law.
"If a game has a lot of cheating, you just really have to hope that the people who run the game, the developers, work their butts off as fast as they can to get that dealt with, because it is an issue," said Eric Wrona, a professional e-gaming player who goes by the gaming name "Snip3down."
"You're fighting a battle, you've already lost. When I have my computer in front of me, I have physical access," said Demirkapi. "It's really difficult for them [video game developers] to actually prevent me from cheating. And the best thing they can do is make the bar high enough to where it's not worth my time."
Many cheats are implemented by modifying game software, despite EULAs which forbid modification. While game software distributed in binary-only versions makes it harder to modify code, reverse engineering is possible. Also game data files can be edited separately from the main program and thereby circumvent protections implemented in software.
In order to help protect against cheats, the games industry might consider ramping up their bug bounty programmes because if good guys can close off bugs that cheaters are going to look to exploit, it will cause much less damage in the long run; even if it can't cut out the bad actors completely.
Anti-cheat software commonly use low-level system interfaces not intended by the OS vendor for public use. As a result, they are a common source of incompatibilities with newer versions of operating systems and security measures as well as alternative OS API implementations such as Wine. For example, Windows enables Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI) by default in every market except Chinese and Korean installations due to anti-cheat compatibility issues.
"People create software to be able to install it in the game without being detected, so it's similar to a virus; you want to attack without being detected, while other things are going on in the background for the user," says Mayra Rosario, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro.
