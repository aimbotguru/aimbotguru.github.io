I Love the game Left to Survive it keeps you thinking and practicing strategies to continue trying to be the best , I wish there was a way to get infinite money and gold as it does get heavy on the wallet, great game thought and would recommend to many.
Left to Survive is an immersive action game created by My.com. And no, the developers did not slouch when it comes to the action part of the game! But at the same time, the game turns out to be surprisingly fun too (disputable of course). This is where the addictive part of the game comes in. When you’re playing, you really can’t help but want to keep playing. This is despite the fact that some players might find the background music a little creepy (not us)!
Overall, Left to Survive is a good game with fun mechanics and game modes. As you play and upgrade your town, you’ll unlock new weapons and find survivors to aid you. However, the need to constantly upgrade your town can quickly make the game feel repetitive.
If you compare the battles of players in Left to Survive with other similar games, it can be noted that in this game, success in battle depends not only on the power of equipment and the reaction of fighters. To win a fight you need to take into account several points at once.
