The aimbot in each cheat is there to assist your aiming to make sure it hits the target even when you aim next to the target. By aiming at the right target, if you press the aimkey (usually the right mouse button) you will see the aim snap directly on target and then you can just shoot and you will be assured of a hit!
Most aimbots are equipped with settings such as smoothing to make the movement of the aiming much more natural, and FOV (field of view) which will ensure the aimbot only aims within that specific circle of view, so you don't accidentally aim at someone behind you.
This implies that the main focus of your character's movement in the game depends on the player's quest for weapons that not just give them a competitive edge against NPCs and different guards yet, in addition, fit their playstyle. Fortunately, Destiny 2 cheats offer a large bundle of weapons but the problem is the game is not easy to play and not everyone can get their hands on these weapons and win the game as well. To enjoy the entirety of the game you need to find Density 2 cheats and get yourself above the competition to enjoy the game without any risk.
In Warzone, for example, aim assist is on by default when playing on a controller and it will help you hit enemies. Aim assist helps you track enemies better so that you can land hits on the body and the head. Aimbot is always going to aim for the head so that you can take out the enemy in a shot or two.
