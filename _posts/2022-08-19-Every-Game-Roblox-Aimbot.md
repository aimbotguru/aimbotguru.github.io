## How to use a roblox aimbot.

It works by taking data from your game and with that data, it’s able to auto lock onto the heads of enemy targets and by so doing, let’s you perform an instant headshot. Now if you are looking for a reliable Roblox aimbot script to use in any game on Roblox, then here you go.

If you are looking for a reliable Roblox Aimbot script that works on pretty much any game on Roblox, then you’re better off with Lucid Universal Aimbot. It’s a cool Aimbot script per se and works on so many Roblox FPS games including Arsenal, Phantom Forces and more.
Likely the most popular aimbot used in Roblox, and one of the most popular script hubs overall, Impulse IY offers more than 200 unique commands that are usable across various games, including the ones mentioned above. Beyond the standard aimbot command, this script includes an infinite jump, auto click, music control, player manipulations, and much more. This massive script is also completely free to download and can be accessed from the developer's official website.
As the FPS genre continues to take off across the Roblox platform with fast-paced and competitive experiences like Arsenal, Big Paintball, and Phantom Forces, the use of game-changing exploits takes off as well. One of the most popular FPS exploits, even outside of Roblox, is the use of an aimbot, or a computerized software that allows the user to take down enemies without ever having to manually aim their weapon—but is this allowed? In the brief guide below we'll be listing some of the most popular FPS aimbot scripts for Roblox that you can use at your own risk.
It’s good to cheat or apply cheats in games that are pretty difficult. While some call it unfair pwning, we think it’s just a game. Now for folks uninformed, Roblox aimbot is a script designed to help players cope with the difficulties of aiming and shooting.

This concludes our list for the five best FPS aimbot scripts that can used to exploit on Roblox. However, we at Pro Game Guides do want to reiterate that cheating on Roblox is prohibited, and that partaking in any form of script altering or implementing is done at your own risk.
Scripts are extra lines of codes that people create to add additional advantages for those who use them, such as the ability to see through walls, auto click, have endless ammo, or, in this case, auto aim. These scripts can be found online rather easily by simply googling Roblox scripts for, followed by whatever advantage you want to acquire. In order to use these scripts, you'll also need a script executor—a computer program that allows users to input custom scripts into any game that they're attempting to exploit.
Unlike many other scripts, Lucid Universal Aimbot Script (LUAS) is free and works with a majority of script executors, both paid and free. This script is a bit more limited than the others on this list in terms of what commands it offers, but as an aimbot specifically, it holds its ground. The only downside to LUAS is that a Vermillion account is needed in order to access the script, which can be seen as sketchy to some.
Note: I, Exunys, have received a lot of feedback about this Aimbot project and by analyzing that a lot of people use this script, I have decided to rewrite this project entirely and implement my modern system for storing, optimizing and tracking. The new project is the perfect aimbot script with a very simple system. I hopefully have fixed every con about this project in the new script. Please check it out, read the repository's README.md document and use that version instead of this one.

## How to detect if you are being aimbotged.

--// Aimbot_G.AimbotEnabled=true-- Determines whether or not the Aimbot script will lock onto players._G.TeamCheck=false-- If set to true then the script would only lock your aim at enemy team members._G.AimPart="Head"-- What body part of the closest enemy the aimbot script would lock at._G.Sensitivity=0-- How many seconds it takes for the aimbot script to officially lock onto the target's aimpart.
The FPS GUI AIMBOT (FGA) from developer DARKSLIM is a bit of dark horse on this list, however its simplicity and continued show of dedication to its users makes it a hidden gem amongst its competitors. Though DARKSLIM is primarily known for developing the popular aimbot script Arsenal Aimbot Gui v0 (AAGv), FGA sits above it in our opinion because of its many uses. While AAGv dominates the scripting world for Arsenal, FGA is compatible with multiple experiences, Arsenal included.
