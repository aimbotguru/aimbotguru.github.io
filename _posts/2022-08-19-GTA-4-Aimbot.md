## Gta 4 aimbot: how to use a cheat to improve your shooting skills.

To increase your shooting ability, you will need to make use of the Rogue Company aimbot. The aimbot or auto-aim is a Rogue Company cheat that gives you special shooting capabilities, with the auto-aim doing the aiming for you and you doing the shooting only. If you have the aimbot, you will not stress trying to aim amid raging fire, which is necessary when the game becomes more intense. The aimbot maximizes your chances of winning the game because you won't need to be a pro at aiming to win but just your keyboard or joystick, and then you'll be getting those fantastic headshots.

Our Arena Blackout aimbot cheats assure you of firing the most accurate shots on the battlefield. Even if you’re an amateur FPS gamer with poor target aiming skills, or if you struggle shooting your enemies from afar, this cheat takes you to the level of a sharpshooter!
The aimbot also comes with a wide range of other complementary features that aim to improve your aim! The Rogue Company aimbot will target your opponents and make you shoot with ease as it also has auto-change, which you can use to shift targets without mastering aim.

People also commented that I was playing sloppily with the aimbot, allowing it to be a crutch. This is very true, and I didn't think of that when I was recording. That said, there are people who use this bot and play with more attention in their game.

I don't know, from watching these videos I got the impression aimbots hadn't really improved in the last 10 years. I haven't really looked at them since I stopped playing FPS games competitively 10 years ago, and I definitely remember aimbots with "loose" lock-on even back then.
PRO
Amazing options for Aim assisting
simple to install
hard to detect
easy to make feel/look legit
cheap
CON Wish there was an option to have "aim assist" type quality where it slowly moved your crosshair/assisted it to the target rather then locking on instantly not a visually appealing menu
your inventory will fill up asap due to the amount of players you will destroy

I had the bot configured to only assist in tracking toward targets while left mouse (my fire button) is held down. No wall cheats were used in either recording, and prediction of enemies dying to a specific shot was performed manually. The bot was only locking on to things within about 20 degrees of my center of view. Any snapping to targets outside of that cone (or while fire wasn't held) was done manually, and most of the small adjustment tracking was also performed manually. I use mouse acceleration such that when I move my mouse slowly it would take 17" of mousepad to do a full 360 (very low), but when I'm moving it quickly it caps out at 6" of mousepad to a 360 (medium-high). Thus I can use flicks for snaps, but I can also do smooth tracking for long-range hitscan too.

Entering cheats in GTA 4 works a little differently to how it does in other GTA games. With the introduction of the mobile phone, Rockstar has allowed players to enter cheats as phone numbers. All you need to do is open the phone menu, enter the call number corresponding to the cheat you wish to trigger, and press call.

Easy "Chain Reaction" achievementJackknife a bus on the Algonquin Bridge so that it is blocking all lanes. Once a bunch of vehicles have piled up, get on top of the bus, and use the RPG and grenades to destroy the vehicles and get the achievement.Create a traffic jam in an enclosed area, such as the Booth tunnel by blocking off both lanes with two vehicles. After the cars back up, steal some of them and squeeze them between the others so that there are three or four next to each other. Throw a grenade at the vehicles in front, then use a RPG to destroy the others.Steal ten vehicles and park them next to each other, preferably in a smaller area, an inside corner, or the outside of a building so there is less of a chance the vehicles will push away when they explode. Then, use a weapon to make at least one vehicle explode. It should start a chain reaction and make the other vehicles explode.Park ten vehicles at any gas station around the pumps. Get an RPG, and aim it at the gas pump. With two shots, all ten cars should explode.Easy "Finish Him" achievementGo to the Helitours located at the bottom right-hand corner of the middle island. There are five employees wearing orange reflective vests. Start with the person that is furthest away from you. If you start fighting with the first person you see, a second one will come over and double-team you. Each person will last about two counters.Easy "Get Good Wood" achievement ("The Lost And Damned" DLC)In a bike race, knock someone off their bike. Then, pull next to their bike. When they try to get back on, knock them off again. Repeat this until you get the "Get Good Wood" achievement.Easy "Join The Midnight Club" achievementKeep joining and quitting matches until you are the host. Then, set the lap number to one, and start a helicopter race with very few opponents.Easy "One Man Army" achievementGo to the bridge that takes you to the second island and has train tracks under it. Walk along the train tracks towards the second island before you are allowed to cross the bridge. When you are about half way, you should have a six start wanted level. Then, just stand on the train tracks for five minutes to get the achievement. You do not have to worry about the police because they will be on the bridge above you so they cannot shoot, and the helicopters are above you so you have cover from them.Go to the hospital at the north-west corner of Algonquin. You can also get there by dying in that general area. Get a motorbike. Set a Waypoint at the hospital or just remember the way you came. Drive to the nearby bridge that takes you to the third island. You must not have access to the third island for this trick to work. Slowly reverse backwards over the barricade on the bridge until you get a six start wanted level. Then, drive straight back to the hospital. To the right of the hospital as you are coming back is a little red fence that you can bust through and get onto the elevated train tracks. Wait there for approximately five minutes to get the achievement. No cars can get to you on the train tracks and the helicopters cannot shoot accurately enough to hit you at motorcycle speed.Attempt to enter one of the locked boroughs early in the game to get an immediate six star wanted level by taking a car on the subway (or elevated train) tracks. This can be done easily near the corner of Grand Boulevard and Leavenworth Ave. in North Bohan near the police station. From Leavenworth, take a left onto Grand, and go up the little hill. When you reach the crest of the hill, look to your left to find a very short wall above a subway tunnel. Drive a car over that short wall, then drive underground toward North Algonquin. When you have a six star wanted level, stop your car and remain there for five minutes to get the achievement.After the middle island is unlocked, steal a helicopter from the helitour site in the southeast corner. Fly over any other area you have not yet unlocked to automatically get a six star wanted level. Fly off the map in any direction, and stay in the air. The police helicopters will only chase you so far. After five minutes, you will get the achievement.Easy "Rolled Over" achievementGo to the airport runway in a fast car (Infernus, Super GT, police cruiser, etc.). There are small yellow ramps scattered in the grass by the runway. Locate one, drive back a good distance, then at full speed hit the ramp so that only half your car actually hits the ramp. You should get enough spins to get the achievement.Go on the Algonquin Bridge that connects Dukes to Algonquin. Find the part where the lanes split at the bridge when going westbound. At the split is a small ramp. Hit that ramp at high speed to make your car roll over several times. Try to land in the lower area for more room to roll over.Easy "Walk Free" achievementGet a four star wanted level, then start a mission to get the achievement.Get on the airport runway with a car, then get out. This will instantly give you a four star wanted level. Then, run or drive to the end of the runway to get the achievement.Start picking off cops one by one. Your wanted level will rise as more of them are killed. After you get a four star wanted level, get in a vehicle, and drive into the subway tunnel. Once you leave the flashing wanted circle and your wanted level disappears, you will get the achievement.Easy "Wheelie Rider" achievementGet a motorbike, and go to Francis International Airport. Go to one end of the runway, start to accelerate, and do a wheelie by pressing Left Analog-stick Down for 500 feet to get the achievement. The runway works best because you have a very long distance where you can drive perfectly straight without worrying about vehicles pulling out in front of you.AchievementsAccomplish the indicated achievement to get the corresponding number of Gamerscore points:
Cheat modeWhile playing the game, press Up to display Niko's cell phone. Press Up again to access the keypad. Then, enter one of the following codes to activate the corresponding cheat function. Once a code has been entered correctly, a new "Cheats" menu option will be available on your phone, below "Options", where you can access the cheats without having to enter the phone number again. Note: Do not save the game after enabling a code to avoid unforeseen problems. Enabling some cheats will prevent the indicated achievement(s) from being earned. You can usually only spawn one vehicle at a time. Any previously spawned vehicles will disappear. However, if you spawn a vehicle, save the game, and load again, you can spawn another one and your original will not disappear. You must have it in your parking space in front of a safehouse or it will be gone before you have a chance to spawn another.
Another cheat to get full health, armor, ammo and repair one's vehicle can be used if the player is driving the Mr. Tasty ice-cream truck; cycle through the ice cream jingles (using the horn button) until the GTA IVtheme plays, then call the ZiT Service (948-555-0100). Although not documented as such, this will block the achievement/trophy 'Finish Him.'
I cheated in Q3 a bit back in the day, I'm quite ashamed to admit that. I was pretty good at the game, except for the Rail Gun, I couldn't hit a barn door at point black using it. So I downloaded a little small and simple cheat, that used the mouse1 when crosshair hovered over the enemy character. Because of it's nature, it was undetectable to a human eye, and I had fun with it in the instagib modes. But the moment people started praising my railgun skills, all the magic was lost, because deep down I knew i'm still shit. That was the last time I used a cheat in the multiplayer game.
