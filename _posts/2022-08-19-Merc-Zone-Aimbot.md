If you don’t have enough points invested into this ability you can pay for a room on the floor below Akulov and you can get a 50% discount if you chose the Street Kid Lifepath. Just make sure the receptionist doesn’t call Akulov. You can also comment on the TV with them and sneakily grab the key sitting on the desk, but this is the most risky choice.
Ghost – When included in a Loadout, this perk will make you undetectable and immune to UAVs, Radar Drones, Heartbeat Sensors, and Snapshot Grenades.

Hardline – An Operator that has Hardline equipped gets a discount on Buy Station prices for Killstreaks, Field Upgrades, Armor Plates, and Vehicles. This hefty discount can add up if you are planning on completing plenty of Contracts or carrying around a ton of Cash, as you’ll be able to get more from a Buy Station than a non-Hardline player. Should you put this perk in your loadout, it may be wise to target your play around Buy Stations.
Pac-Man's world has been unhinged in Pac-Man Tilt. Take control of Pac-Man in twisting 2D platforming levels filled with perilous obstacles, power pellets and wandering ghosts. Using the accelerometer capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS system, players will be able to literally tilt Pac-Man's world from side to side in order to solve devious environmental puzzles and sneak past roaming enemies. Pac-Man can also use pinball flippers, spring boards and other objects placed throughout each level to help him reach each level's goal. Tilting the screen when Pac-Man has a running start will cause him to roll into a ball, giving him an extra boost of speed and access to narrow tunnels. Strategically using all of Pac-Man's abilities will be the only way to complete this all-new and exciting adventure. Galaga 3D Impact immerses players into the role of a gunner on a space ship against an all-out war with the dreaded Galaga aliens. Using the Nintendo 3DS system's gyroscopic and 3D technology, players are able to maneuver their perspective within the seat of the turret to aim and shoot enemies as they try to lay siege against the human race. The player’s real-life movements correspond to the action represented on-screen in an impressive mash-up of arcade shooter and virtual reality.
My client wants Akulov’s datashard, supposedly containing valuable intel on talks with the Japanese. Go the hotel where Akulov’s staying and swipe that data out from under his nose. As if it needs to be said but he’ll have heavy protection. And remember I’ll pay extra if you get in and out without a trace.
