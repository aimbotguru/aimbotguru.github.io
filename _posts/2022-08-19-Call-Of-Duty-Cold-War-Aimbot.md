## Can a call of duty aimbot work on pc?

Requirements note:
Please read the requirements on the product page BEFORE you purchase. If you game on a 3XXX NVIDIA card, then the aimbot will not work for you. This is listed in the requirements, so it helps reading those. I will release an update soon to support 3XXX NVIDIA cards.

This cheat requires you to actually tweak the aimbot settings (and a few of the COD CW in-game settings) to actually work good for you. I am posting this to make sure that people being unsure about their purchase realize that it all just comes down to your cheat config.
If someone doesn't invest 10 minutes of his time to tweak the cheat for his liking, then you will most likely get bad results. However, aimbot works fine once you found good config values for yourself
Just like the PS4 the, Aimbot cheat would not work in the Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War game on the Xbox One in the absence of Xim Apex. It helps the gamer snap the enemy quickly and shoot them faster with features like super jump, quickly running, and lots more. To work with this device, you require a gaming mouse and keyboard. Both mouse and keyboard are plugged directly into the Xim Apex device. Once you get done with the initial setting, you are ready to download cheats on your mobile phone and then transfer them to the Xim Apex. As the Call of Duty Black Ops Cold Waris a multiplayer game, so for a better playing experience, you need cheats that help you play well, and most importantly, it ensures risk-free playing by eliminating the fear of getting banned with the right moves.
Will this work with a 1660? And let me get this straight this is a heavily based pixel aimbot? And only works if you have a certain attachment? So how would it work in zombies then if I don't have the attachment? Also did you ever get hit by any waves with your MW aim assist?
Please note: Due to the aim assist running through your NVIDIA GPU it will have an effect on your game performance (FPS). The better your GPU and CPU the less fps you lose and the better the aim assist works. Average loss is 20 fps among users. Since the aim assist relies on your in-game gsettings you will have to use specific graphic settings (for most clear visuals) from our tutorial and to run a specific weapon attachment on your guns to allow the aim assist to perform at it’s best. Premade config files for the cheat can be found in our Discord server.

Using the Call Of Duty Mobile Hacks is pretty simple, but remember that you can get banned from the game forever if you are caught or someone else reports you. Here are some steps that work on Android devices, but as iOS is a closed system, it is impossible to use cheats on iPhones or iPad.
Edit note #3:
I uploaded a seperate build for Laptop users who were not able to run the cheat before. If you are an exisiting customer who had this issue please open a support ticket on my server to get your new version.If you are a new user then this new "laptop" build will be in your email you receive upon purchase, labeled as "COD MW Aim Assist (LAPTOP USERS ONLY).
All of your questions have been either answered in this thread or on the website. This is an NVIDIA GPU based aimbot, scanning for player shapes, pixel combinations, distances and color combinations. You won't find a normal pixelbot achieving that.
1070 is the minimum requirement. Aimbot might still work with 1660 but most likely not as good as intended. I don't recommend buying with that GPU. The weapon attachment is recommended but not necessary for the aimbot to work. The attachment will just make it work better on longer ranges. As answered previously in this thread (just a few post above this one): I haven't had a single detection on any of my COD products yet.
Even though aimbots undoubtedly offer you godlike aim and accuracy, it is essential to take precautions if you decide to use them. There is a high chance that your account could get banned if you are caught using them in an online game; therefore, it is crucial to beware of the risks. For instance, several large games have banned hundreds of thousands of accounts for using cheats and cheats, and there is no sign of them stopping.

## How to detect a call of duty aimbot.

Aimbot or Auto-aim is the most popular Call Of Duty Mobile cheat. As you can tell from the name, it allows the person using the cheat to kill the enemy without even aiming at the opponent. Instead, the aimbot program tracks the players and automatically kills them once they are available in vision. Furthermore, if you are using this cheat, the enemy can’t kill you. Therefore, someone who uses the cheat will always know where you are and can kill you with just a single shot.
♦ Aimbot / Aim assist 9/10
Aimbot works very well but not as good as a memory aimbot ofc. However the security makes it worth it♦ Setup/Config 9/10
You will need to tweak the aimbot config for it to work good with your own gameplay and Cod settings. Took me about 10 minutes.♦ Support 10/10
I have bought several products from Shell before. He and his mods are very helpful when you have an issue.♦ Security 10/10
Can't obviously tell yet but I haven't been banned and since I never got banned with any other Shell products I used I am sure this will also remain undetected
The aimbot is an integral part of any cheats package for a shooter game, and Black Ops Cold War is no exception. We’ve put a lot of effort into our Cold War aimbot to make it the best around with multiple customizations, from legit to rage at your desire. You’ll be hard-pressed to find an aimbot that has as many options and features as ours.
Essentially, the aimbot software utilizes data from your screen or the actual game to detect whether or not an enemy is present and their exact location. Since players often take a little while to identify an enemy, their aim-in will be slow, and they might even end up getting shot. To combat this, aimbots aim and shoot in an instant and with deadly accuracy.
Trigger bot is the alternative variant of aimbot. Trigger bot automatically shoots down any enemy opponent who comes within your crosshair. Using this cheat does not require good reflexes that triggerbot programming to shoot down as soon as any enemy enters your crosshair.
This is probably the one cheat in the world that needs no introduction at all. We’re talking of course about aimbot, something which everyone knows about and something that is inarguably one of the most powerful cheats out there. But an aimbot is only as strong as it is good, and lucky for you, it doesn’t get much better than the Black Ops Cold War aimbot cheat that we provide. Our aimbot is simply a must-have while playing Black Ops Cold War. Regardless of which weapon you’re using from the game’s huge arsenal, you’ll be a deadly killer in the game who’ll be able to take down all foes with haste and significant ease.

To add even more to its already amazing power, we’ve also given our aimbot the capability of helping players do much more than just aim good. While giving you perfect aim like none other, our aimbot will also be helping you deal a huge amount of more damage than you usually would be dealing with your weapon. There’s lots of other cool features to try out too, like the movement prediction feature as well as the bone prioritizations.
If you can’t lock onto targets and pull the trigger within fractions of a second, you can say ‘goodbye’ to your killstreak.
