## Fortnite is a popular video game that has been growing in popularity since it was released in 2017.

Fortnite has risen to become one of the most popular free-to-play battle royale games in existence before exploding into a mass culture phenomenon. The game is played by millions around the world and has also allowed a number of popular eSports gamers to gain massive popularity.

Another video shows Fortnite as one of the most searched games in the world, it being one of the most popular games from 2017 until right now. The amount of people talking about Fortnite doesn’t seem like it’s significantly trending downward, though Animal Crossing and Valorant leapfrogged it in the early parts of 2020 in terms of searches.
We here at TechACake.com share new video game statistics every week. However, we’ve been waiting for the right moment to collect data for Fortnite - one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world. What’s not to love: Fortnite is free-to-play, beautifully designed, and available on most gaming platforms in 2022. (Make sure to check out our Gaming category for the latest player count of many popular video games on your way out.) Without further ado, let’s get ahead and talk about Fortnite!
Fortnite and PUBG were both released in 2017 and they changed the world of video games by introducing a brand new and exciting video game genre - battle royale. PUBG is one of the best games like Fortnite (scroll down and discover the other battle royale games that are worth your time in 2022) and oftentimes people compare the two.
It is not the first time cyber criminals have attempted to take advantage of Fortnite's record-breaking popularity. Since launching in 2017, Fortnite has grown into the world's most popular online video game, with an estimated 250 million players around the world.

Both PUBG and Fortnite came out in 2017 and they took the world of video gaming by storm. Since then, battle royale has become one of the most popular video game genres with more and more games coming up every year. In 2022, millions of people play Fortnite every day and seasonal events push the Fortnite player count even higher than usual. How many people play Fortnite in 2022? Let’s find out:
Is Fortnite dying in 2022? Not even close! Millions of people play the game every day and our research conclusively proved that Fortnite is indeed the most popular battle royale game in 2022. One of the things that makes players come back to the game is that the developers upload new content frequently and collaborate with some of the most popular franchises to spice things up in the game.
As for consoles, Fortnite was a launch title for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X | S, meaning that it has hit yet another new platform. Adoption rates for the new consoles will likely be low to begin with, though as more people buy the new consoles, that will only make Fortnite’s player figures soar even higher.
Having burst onto the scene in 2017, Fortnite has since become a worldwide phenomenon, amassing 350 million players across the globe as of May 2020. When looking at mobile shooter game downloads, it is clear that the mobile version of Fortnite has also been a great success, having been downloaded 78 million times in the first year of its release.

## One of the features that has made fortnite so popular is the snipers, who use powerful guns to take down opponents from a long distance.

The Heavy Sniper Rifle is one of the strongest weapons in Fortnite, dealing massive damage to opponents, structures, and vehicles. But if you don’t have good enough aim to land headshots on the first attempt, the slow reload and one-bullet clip could be an issue.
We never thought we’d be putting a pistol in the B Tier of Fortnite guns (previously, they’ve been C Tier at best), but the Sidearm Pistol has actually proven its worth on quite a few occasions, dealing an impressive amount of damage at close range – particularly headshots – with a very fast reload time.
It’s a similar situation with the Revolver. It can be useful in close-range situations and does pack quite a punch, but its slow rate of fire means that if you miss, you’re leaving yourself wide open to damage. There are much better Fortnite guns this season.
Fortnite is famous for the crossovers with other franchises. It's one of the things fans love most about Fortnite - you never know what to expect from the next Fortnite season. Everybody loves a quality mashup, right? Most of those mash ups are all about cosmetics (characters and setting), soundtracks, and weapons. Let’s see:
The DMR is a brilliant addition to any loadout, giving you zoomed-in accuracy that helps target opponents from a medium-to-long distance. Unlike sniper rifles, it can fire multiple shots without having to reload, which makes it one of the best Fortnite guns this season.
And last but not least - Fortnite vs Apex gameplay. Now, Fortnite definitely steals the thunder with some Marvel or Star Wars characters appearing in new seasons but that’s not all of it. With battle royale games there’s a lot of moving around and hurrying to get inside the circle when you hear the siren. There are so many means of transportation in Fortnite and some of them are really imaginative (e.g. shopping carts, golf carts, planes). However, Apex is way more fast-paced than Fortnite and offers players a more intense gaming experience.
Surviving in Fortniteand securing a Victory Royale takes skill and luck. Getting better at Fortnite requires a knowledge of the playing field and a drive to outlast your opponents, but none of that matters if you aren’t picking up the right weapons. Building a loadout that suits your playstyle and managing your inventory as the match progresses is key to snagging a win. You don’t want to be caught in a long-range battle against someone on a mountaintop without a solid rifle on hand, and you certainly don’t want to find yourself inside a close-quarters building without an SMG or shotgun.
Twitch streamers are kind of like the Kardashians of the gaming community. Jokes aside, some of them really become minor celebrities and their streams attract thousands of Twitch viewers. Fortnite ranks #6 on Twitch and it’s only natural that there would be some epic content happening on Fortnite Twitch.
Fortnite Battle Royale received generally positive reviews on all platforms. Daniel Tack of Game Informer gave the game 9.5/10 and praised the "stylish and colorful visuals", "incredibly easy" playability, high replayability and called it an "a frenzy of fresh, fantastical fun". Michael Higham of Gamespot gave the game 8/10 and praised the "intuitive" building mechanics, "unexpected" challenges, "fresh" updates, though criticized its repetitive resource-gathering and map traversal and "bare" main towns. Austen Golsin of IGN gave the game 9.6/10 and stated, "Thanks to the freedom of its outstanding building mechanic, Fortnite Battle Royale isn’t just a great battle royale game – it’s one of the best multiplayer games in recent history."

## However, there is one player in the game who has been able to bypass the snipers and take them down easily - by using a fortnite ps4 aimbot.

Fortnite aimbots and cheaters can make an already difficult game basically impossible. It's bad enough when it's you versus 99 other players, but did that headshot come from a Twitch streamer or some filthy cheater using some sort of cheat program? The bad news: Fortnite cheaters definitely exist. The good news: You can fight back with a few crucial tips, and make the game a more inviting place for all players.
You will be able to hit anyone easily with the Fortnite Aimbot Settings. No matter if you are using Shotguns, SMGs, Assult Riffles, or even Snipers, for that matter. As long as you can judge the distance between you and your target correctly, you will be able to shoot them. So, let’s get into the Aimbot settings without any further ado.
Fortnite is also filled with Aimbots and cheaters who can make the game much more difficult and impossible to win for players. It is very likely that you have been gunned down by a cheater that used a cheat. However, there are still a number of ways you can fight back using a few simple tips to make the game a more inviting place, especially for new players. And while aimbots can be frustrating at times, they may also be fun for starters. One of the best things about using an Aimbot cheat is that it allows even the most novice players in the game to aim like a pro.
Not really, no. BattlEye has not released any information about Fortnite just yet, but it's an ongoing battle between cheat developers and anti-cheat companies. As soon as one cheat is tracked and bottlenecked by BattlEye, you can bet another one is being developed to circumvent the system and continue to create an unfair advantage for nefarious players. Even so, we're not seeing an epidemic of aimbot users crowding public games. Malware scams are far more worrisome.
PC Systems: You can purchase various PC aimbots for Fortnite online. We suggest you visit Elite PVPers Fortnite Black Market as they have a shop section with user reviews. The current cheat with the most views and least amount of bans comes from Disrupt and includes a rage cheat.
Console systems: Purchase the Cronus Zen from CronusMax. This device allows you to use the aimbot esp, no recoil, and more in Fortnite without having to worry about a ban. You can see videos and more on the Cronus Zen website. Radar cheats won’t work on console systems and neither will a speedcheat, spinbot, noclip, fly, or aimlock.
When this occurs, they become dangerous opponents and are able to take out real Fortnite players with ease. It's unclear if this is intentional or if Epic Games is testing out a new algorithm for bots. Whichever the case, it's a strange anomaly and does not occur too often in-game.
The private Fortnite cheat info below will keep you undetected in every Fortnite battle. Many people try using free Fortnite cheats and end up getting banned, don’t be that person. Infinite health and aimbot Fortnite mobile can sometimes get you banned by the games anti cheat.
Epic has taken action against players that have used in-game cheats, like aimbots, to gain a competitive edge when these are discovered. In one notable case, Jarvis Khattri, a member of FaZe Clan, was given a lifetime Fortnite ban in November 2019 after he had posted a video which showed how aimbots within Fortnite worked, despite having cautioned his viewers to not use aimbots nor providing details of how to acquire the aimbot. The ban was controversial as Khattri had developed his esports career on Fortnite, and FaZe Clan had started discussions with Epic Games to reduce the ban in context of the video clip.

## This aimbot allows players to automatically select the target that they want to shoot at, making it much easier to take down opponents.

The aimbot like the one above will not only snap a player's aim to an enemy with the click of a button, but it helps them see things through walls, too. The clip is from a YouTube video uploaded in September 2018, when season six of Fortnite began, so it's a bit old, but still indicative of a problem plenty of players still face today. More recently, Fortnite pro and FaZe clan member "Jarvis" was banned from the game for the use of aimbot during casual matches.
Our Aimbot Settings are pretty straightforward. These settings replicate the style used by an aimbot, which is helpful for Fortnite beginners or casual players of the video game. The settings here are set so that your aim will match the speed of your target. For example, if the enemy is running and you are using these settings. Then it will be much easier for you to track them with your controller, which otherwise would have been difficult. If you get lucky with our aim settings, your aim and accuracy in Fortnite will greatly improve, eventually allowing you to level up fast.
This guide will help you achieve the Fortnite Aimbot Settings for the new season. These settings are called AImbot settings because they will make you feel like using an Aimbot with the controller. So by using these settings, you will be able to do a lot. You will win most of your battles, your aim will be much more accurate, and lastly, you will secure more Victory Royales in Fortnite. It’s worth considering that the literal Aimbot is an entirely different story. That is cheating in the game, but settings, on the other hand, are not so that you can use our settings to up your game.
Lastly, b/c the aim bot is usually written to detect and lock on the person closest to you -- in small groups of fraggers in persay DM -- the distance b/w himself and the opponents is constantly changing thus the bot whips him in directions he's not prepared for usuaully ending in a suicide. no real control of his aim unless he's standing at a far distance w/ LG.
The console version of this cheat is great because, unlike a computer that takes time to aim properly as well as hold down buttons on the keyboard or mouse, all one has to do is press some buttons on their gamepad while aiming in order to instantly take out opponents without even having any type of skill whatsoever. If you see a Fortnite cheats free download stay away it will get your account banned.
But it's easy to see why people seek them out. One of the most popular aimbot programs sports a sleek website design and a one-time payment for a lifetime of use. Its site offers numerous videos showing off the cheats in action, enabling wallcheats and an aimbot for easy kills.
Now, these settings are the opposite of what we just went through. The Aim Down Settings or ADS settings will affect your aim when you are holding the LT (Left Trigger) to aim. These settings are where the Aimbot feeling in Fortnite kicks in. When using these settings, you will realize in terms of aiming just how better you have gotten in the game.
Once you have the Aimbot settings for Fortnite, you will need to get used to them before utilizing them. Just like any other setting, you will need to get a handle on these first. But once you have done the basic homework on these settings, you will notice just how much your aim has improved. This concludes today’s guide but if you have any questions regarding the Fortnite Aimbot Settings, let us know in the comments below.
The cheat’s aimbot does not discriminate; it has no mercy. If you try to run, duck, or jump the cheat will always track your every move until it finds its target and then blasts them away with a shotgun without hesitation. You can swim but that doesn’t help at all when this god-like cheater is after you.

## Many people are concerned that this kind of cheating will ruin the fun of the game, but so far it seems to have had little impact on its popularity.

For many, cheating utterly ruins the experience of a multiplayer video game. Even if you are not directly affected, it breaks the social contract. “When people play a competitive game together, they conjure the world of that game into existence through mutual agreement: this is the aim, these are the restrictions on how we can achieve that aim,” says game designer Holly Gramazio. “When you realise that someone is cheating, it can disrupt that mutual agreement and call the whole experience into question.”
Unfortunately, there is a chronic cheating problem in online multiplayer games. The servers of first-person shooters such as Call of Duty, PUBG and Counter-Strike are utterly rife with cheaters, most of whom download special software that alters the game in their favour. That might be aimbots, which make it easy for them to shoot other players; wall cheats, which render walls invisible so players can easily spot their opponents; or speed cheats, which allow them to move much faster. Such cheats are largely confined to PC games, where players are able to alter the code in client software, but console games are also vulnerable to exploits (using errors in a game design to get an advantage) and “lag switching” (disrupting the network communication to other players). Now that many multiplayer titles allow cross-platform play, PlayStation and Xbox owners are coming up against PC players who are using cheats to get an advantage.
The sudden rise of cheaters in the game makes players wonder why it is happening. When the Battle Royale game was released, there were hardly any cheaters. The few who managed to cheat got instantly banned due to the strict anti-cheat. Things have changed in the last few months.
And this isn’t only in professional and competitive leagues and ranked matches, where there are prizes at stake. This is on public servers against complete strangers with nothing tangible at stake apart from a few stats. Publishers are doing what they can to address the issue, utilising third-party anti-cheat systems such as BattlEye, while working on patches to block cheat programs and remove players who use them. Last week, Activision banned 60,000 players from its battle royale game Call of Duty: Warzone for using cheat software – over 300,000 permanent bans have now been administered. And that’s just one game. The problem is, when one cheat app is blocked another is developed and distributed. Demand is high. Why? Why are people cheating this much?
Fortunately, Epic Games is already on the offense against people who build and sell cheats. The studio has filed multiple legal suits against such people to stop them from spreading cheats. Moreover, they are also recovering damages to make up for all the experiences ruined by such cheats.
There are also important moral distinctions to be made between different forms of cheating. Gramazio is the editor of Bernard de Koven’s wonderful book The Infinite Playground about the shared imaginative spaces that games provide and the ways in which rules and regulations can be altered by players to enhance the experience. A good example from board games is Monopoly, where some families agree to stash all the money paid out in fines under the free parking square so that the player who lands there gets to keep it all. It’s a cheat, but it’s one all participants have agreed on and endorsed. An example from video games might be rocket jumping in Quake Arena – it’s cheating, but it is also an accepted tactic, so it’s fine.
The moral rules of video game participation are complex and ambiguous. We’ve grown up with cheat codes, pokes and exploits as an accepted element of play – designers themselves have often coded these elements into their own products. And the very structure of game worlds, with their hidden shortcuts and secrets, suggests to players that these are negotiable spaces, where law, morality and even geography, can be bent to the will of determined protagonists. Games are also places where victory is paramount, where winning is everything. So should we be surprised that people want to cheat?
The complaints are grounded on the basis that code has been tampered with, which is stated as prohibited in the game’s End User Agreement. “In using cheat software to modify the game’s code in this way” continues the complaint. “Defendant and other cheaters who use the cheat create unauthorized derivative works based on Fortnite in violation of the Copyright Act.”
