## Energy assault aims to be the most powerful cheat for battle royale games on the market.

Another source of shenanigans are ki teleports. It's essentially a counter that will consume an energy bar for teleporting behind the attacker and smacking him on the noggin. First off, the smack can be cancelled into a combo of your choice; but then the AI will immediately pull them off wherever a human player has to first input guard, and then the combo. Second, should you do a ki teleport, the AI will immediately follow up with another one, and another one, and ANOTHER one, so long as they come up on top. Doesn't help that sometimes the AI will cheat and use less energy per teleport to guarantee getting the last laugh.

The wrestling minigame in the Gold Saucer. It's set up in a rock-paper-scissors style of punch-kick-block, but at stage 4, the AI will land a hit when previously your attacks would cancel out. And if you manage to beat Stage 4, Stage 5 takes the cheating to a whole new level - the opponent is invincible, and all of their attacks cancel out yours, so it's physically impossible to win!
Also in Tekken 7, the ridiculous "Special Battle" fighters you randomly encounter while in Treasure Battle mode. Akuma, Devil Kazumi, Devil Kazuya, battle damaged Heihachi and regular Jin. They all have one stupidly annoying thing in common; their Rage Art is an instant one hit kill. It doesn't matter if you get them down to a sliver of health, if they get lucky (and they will) and land their Rage move, it'll instantly win the round for them, even if you were at full health!
In addition to pulling the same infinite energy meter bullshit as the previous game, this game is where it becomes very blatant that the enemy vehicles have unlimited specials. Get anywhere near Axle or Club Kid and they'll fire off 3 or 4 of their specials in quick succession, effectively causing unavoidable damage.
Eternal Champions on the Sega Genesis and Sega CD took the unusual approach of requiring "inner energy" for all special moves. Theoretically, this forced the player to learn the characters and apply specific strategies in every possible matchup... Except against the AI, which could always execute specials with sheer and utter disregard of its own energy levels. Even more, well, insulting, characters have an ability called Insult which allows them to sacrifice one piece of their special gauge to destroy a little more of their opponents. The computer, especially the final boss (bosses in the Sega CD version), is quite fond of repeatedly Insulting you from a distance to render you impotent — usually shortly before, with a blatantly flashing EMPTY gauge, they execute their ultimate full-gauge-requiring attacks, some of which doing things like rendering the character completely invincible (the final boss(es) have these, naturally). Did we mention if you lose in the final battle, you can't continue?

The show Ace Lightning, about the characters of a video game coming to life, sees the game's creator specifically creating a new leader for the villains in the second season to give them a totally unfair boost in power. Not only is this character, Kilobyte, almost unbeatable, he can defeat most opponents by draining their energy with a touch from his tentacles, he can upgrade the other villains by giving them new powers and weapons, and can weaken the heroes by doing things like making them capable of feeling fear. The only thing keeping the heroes competitive is their human friends inventing new power-ups for them outside of the stuff from the game.
The major antagonist of Tales of Vesperia , Alexei is famous for ripping out his Mystic Arte, Brilliant Cataclysm, multiple times in a battle and he can do it up to 10 times on higher difficulties. Brilliant Cataclysm has a huge area of effect and does enormous amounts of damage. He cheats in multiple ways. First, he can use a skill that is a powerful attack and a healing spell at the same time without consuming TP, often spamming it to a point at which he heals faster than you can damage him. If you set your AI to stay away from the enemy, they will move in on him before he uses Brilliant Cataclysm to ensure that they are within the area of effect. If you get close to actually winning the battle, he can activate Brilliant Cataclysm without having to go into Over Limit, and it will override an All-Divide (that is supposed to halve all the damage dealt by both you and the enemy), usually killing your entire party in a single blow.
100% Orange Juice: While the game's heavy reliance on dice rolls means you might always think the computer is cheating, the final boss, Tomomo, explicitly rigs her dice so she rolls high, making it very difficult to directly attack her. There is also an Extreme difficulty that gives this benefit to all of your AI opponents.
Super Godzilla for the Super Nintendo did this against, well, pretty much everyone. Your own fighting spirit (a measure of how strong your techniques are) rises pretty slowly, compared to the UFO which is nearly permanently at maximum, or Mechagodzilla, who can go from nothing to max in a heartbeat, and teleport-body-slam you in the process. He will then use eye lasers just to mess with you. If you want to pull off the killer moves with a full bar, you absolutely need the booster item to fill it faster, because the enemy will hit you first otherwise.

## Energy assault is a cheat that allows you to sprint and heal for an extended period of time.

The game currently has six game modes: Hill Control, Domination, Team Deathmatch, Free For All (FFA), Artifact, and Capture the Flag (CTF). A match in Energy Assault lasts for 10 minutes (it used to be 15 minutes during early versions) and the team with the highest score wins.

Attacking the player during their turn by taking advantage of the fact that the "heart" symbol (which represents the player's soul) is also used as a cursor during battle, thereby dealing them damage by having their attack pass over said heart between turns.
Scientists call this method reduced-exertion high-intensity interval training, or REHIT, because your perceived exertion is lower than what you experience during traditional HIIT workouts. That makes sticking with REHIT easier than other types of exercises.
The game based on the Dragon Booster television show is guilty of this. While you only ever have five energy points, and have to recharge by getting powerups, the AI racers have unlimited energy, ignore obstacles (offscreen, at least; onscreen, they just charge into nearly all of them), and even have equipment that is unable to be obtained by the player. It's made up for in that the AI is dumb as a post.
“High-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) or sprint interval training (SIT), is a form of interval training, a cardiovascular exercise strategy alternating short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods, until too exhausted to continue.”
A shield to block everything that can last as long as the AI wants. They can't do anything while it's active, but since they don't need to guard or gather energy, and they have other attack buffs (see below), this just means that the player is lulled into gathering energy so the computer can attack at a moment's notice.
Tekken 5's Jinpachi Mishima was a great example of this trope. He had The Stomp, an auto-stun move that didn't do damage but left your character floating and unable to block for at least seven seconds, an eternity in a fighting game. This was even worse in Dark Resurrection, when the computer learned how to do juggles with three signature uppercuts in a row, which took off about half your health. The version of the character given to the player, of course, did not have nearly as much priority for the stomp, which also had to be timed with the enemy attack (unlike the AI version which could just be done whenever).
