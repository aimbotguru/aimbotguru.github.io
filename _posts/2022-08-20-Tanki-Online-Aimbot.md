## This tanki online aimbot is easy to use and can help you win battles quickly and easily.

2 months before the start of active development of Tanki Online by AlternativaPlatform team, they came up with a demo what was supposed to demonstrate the possibilities of the server platform. The code name for the demo was “Tanks”. It was a multiplayer action game about tanks based on Flash. The demo was developed using the Alternativa3D 5 graphics engine. Tanks became the prototype of Tanki Online. Garage there was much more diverse than the one in Tanks for Two. Players had a choice of three types of tanks: light, medium and heavy. However, there was only one gun. It required one, two and three hits to destroy light, medium and heavy hull respectively. Tanks had only one map that actually was a single 3D-model (maps in Tanki Online are made of many blocks called props). It also contained water.
Here is an archive video of what the game looked like:

About thirteen years ago, there was an ancestor of Tanki Online – a game called Tanks for Two. It was designed as an experiment, by young Anton Volkov (wolf) and Alexander Karpovich (karp) – founders of AlternativaPlatform and Tanki Online. Small, simple, with graphic that reminded players of old java-games for mobile phones and only two players – it was that simple.
Thanks to this project, there came the idea of ​​a tank multiplayer shooter.
This page contains Tanki Online cheats, hints, walkthroughs and more for PC. This game has been made by Alternativa Platform and published . Tanki Online was made in "action" genre. Right now we have 26 Cheats and etc for this game and every day we increase our collection with new Tanki Online cheats If you can not find the needed cheat in our list, check this page periodically or subscribe for this game's updates!
The gameplay of "Tanki Online" has some parallels with the famous classic game Battle City (1985). However, unlike Battle City, the basis of the gameplay of "Tanki Online" is a PVP system - player versus player. Players compete with each other, every destroyed tank counts a frag and the player who made the frag receives experience points.
The game has several battle modes (including teamplay-based modes), a system of military ranks and a lot of options for tank customization. Instead of choosing a tank from a premade list, players are encouraged to assemble their own battle machine, combining turrets, hulls, protective modules, drones, and decorative paints, according to their preferences.
When the player is finished with customizing their tank, they can enter into a battle with other players, where, in addition to experience points, they can earn one of the game currency - crystals. Moving up the career ladder, they open up access to new options and products.
The players can strengthen their tank on the battlefield with the help of supply drop boxes: increased damage, increased armor, nitrous and the repair kit. The fifth drop box is the “Nuclear Energy”, which when picked up recharges the Overdrive – a unique hull ability. Players also can purchase the supplies in the garage and use them on the battlefield anytime.
There are two currencies in the game: crystals and Tankoins.
Crystals are used to purchase equipment (turrets, hulls, protective modules and drones) in the garage, augments for turrets and supplies. Crystals are earned by playing in battles, completing challenges (Battle Pass), opening weekly and regular containers, opening coinboxes, taking Gold Boxes (drop boxes that contain 1000 crystals), exchanging Tankoins, using promocodes, and participating in contests from the game helpers and developers.
Players can buy regular containers, coinboxes, crystals, sets, skins, paints, the ability to change their nickname, a clan license, and Gold Boxes for Tankoins. Tankoins are earned by completing challenges, opening weekly containers, opening coinboxes, purchasing them with real money, using promocodes, and participating in contests from the game helpers and developers.
The game was presented in May 2009 at the KRI 2009 conference, where it won "Best Non-Publisher Game" and "Best Technology" awards. "Tanki Online" used the company's own game engine, Alternativa3D.
The release took place in the same year.
In 2013 and 2014, the project became the winner of the "Runet Prize" in the "Popular Vote" category.

This was the most awaited gun in the history of Tanki Online. The marketing department says that, when being first released, it was bought at a speed of 3 guns per second. The length of the gun was such that if you had it on a wasp, it would be two times the size of the hull. At first the shaft gun had a lot of disadvantages but the biggest of which was its inability to hold a full charge (it left the barrel as soon as you fully charged the gun). But there was one good point – the damage it dealt – M3 Shaft had a damage of 250!
Then it was temporarily removed from the game for rebalancing. Updated Shaft was able to hold its charge, but M3 damage was lowered from 250 to 200.
On March 25, 2012 Tanki Online welcomed its 10 000 000th player! His nickname was lYonsl.
The game was getting really popular.
On April 1 players spotted a strange item in their Garages – the Green Triangle. Lots of speculations were made regarding its origin and purpose. Many thought that it was an element of some quest. Players were even calling battles “Green Triangle”.
Developers introduced really expensive paints with good protection from various turrets.
On February 14, 2011 a new gun was added to the main servers – the famous Smoky XT. It was more expensive than a standard Smoky and had better parameters. During one week, any player with a rank of Warrant Officer 1 and higher could buy Smoky XT and use it till February 22. The next day Smoky XT’s damage was increased and it was decided to keep the gun in the game for two more days. The event got lots of feedback from players (not a surprise as there were no changes like that before). The new gun became a number one discussion topic both in the game and in the forum. At 4:00 (UTC+0) on February 24 Smoky XT was removed from the game forever.
he name of the period itself explains global changes in Tanki Online. Second generation of weapons and hulls was introduced. They were three hulls: Viking, Hornet and Mammoth and three turrets: Thunder, Ricochet and Freeze.
Many new maps were added. The looks of the game changed significantly. Tanki Online had from 1 000 000 to 4 000 000 active players at that time.
The demand for first generation weapons dropped significantly. There were rumors about a mysterious gun called Shaft.
The game implements a system of ranks, which gives the player access to new features: purchasing new turrets and improving existing ones; purchasing new paints; purchasing supplies; access to maps and modes. The next rank is assigned to the player automatically when a certain number of "experience" points are accumulated. Reaching the next rank is rewarded with 1 regular container.
