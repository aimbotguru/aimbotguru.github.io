Lunar Client aims to stop cheats and not to facilitate them.

Players can even find customizations for their Minecraft avatar in the store that can be accessed specifically through Lunar, including cloaks, emotes, wings, and much more.

Cosmic Client is considered one of the best Minecraft clients, not just because of all the good it does but also because of its server. A CosmicPvP server is available for the Client where you can explore and survive on six planets. In addition, the game offers tournaments and invasions, the possibility to customize enchantments, and fight new AI bosses. Furthermore, it also offers a mobile game set in the same universe as the server.
Cosmic Client is a business in and of itself. As well as boosting your FPS and enhancing your Minecraft experience, it also offers customer service and ways to make gaming easier. Changing accounts is easy, setting waypoints (marking locations) is simple, and you can make changes to your mods in just a few clicks.
Minecraft clients are often confused for servers but they’re not the same thing. Your client runs for you, while a server does its job for everyone. A client is something you can download on your PC that improves your gameplay or adds mods and other features, similar to a launcher.
