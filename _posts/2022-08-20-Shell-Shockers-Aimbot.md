## A shellshocker is an attack on the linux operating system that exploits a security problem.

Shellshock is a vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running Bash, a common command-line interpreter used in many Linux- and Unix-based operating systems. The vulnerability was discovered in September 2014 and impacts versions of Bash released prior to 4.3.

Shellshock, also known as Bashdoor, is a family of security bugs in the UnixBashshell, the first of which was disclosed on 24 September 2014. Shellshock could enable an attacker to cause Bash to execute arbitrary commands and gain unauthorized access to many Internet-facing services, such as web servers, that use Bash to process requests.
Shellshock is a vulnerability that affects Unix-based systems and was discovered in September 2014. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the target system. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Bash shell, which is used by many Unix-based systems.The vulnerability was patched by Bash developers shortly after it was discovered, but many systems may not have been updated yet. Systems that are not patched are vulnerable to attack.

The vulnerability is called Shellshock, and it has rocked the security industry to its core. A flaw in the “Bash” shell—the command line interpreter for Unix-based systems including Linux and Mac OS X—has sent server administrators scrambling to patch their systems.

Diving deeper into the technical, Shellshock is a security bug in the Bash shell (GNU Bash up to version 4.3) that causes Bash to execute unintentional bash commands from environment variables. Threat actors exploiting the vulnerability can issue commands remotely on the target host. While Bash is not inherently Internet-facing, many internal and external services such as web servers do use environment variables to communicate with the server’s operating system.
Shellshock is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability that offers a way for users of a system to execute commands that should be unavailable to them. This happens through Bash's "function export" feature, whereby one Bash process can share command scripts with other Bash processes that it executes. This feature is implemented by encoding the scripts in a table that is shared between the processes, known as the environment variable list. Each new Bash process scans this table for encoded scripts, assembles each one into a command that defines that script in the new process, and executes that command. The new process assumes that the scripts found in the list come from another Bash process, but it cannot verify this, nor can it verify that the command that it has built is a properly formed script definition. Therefore, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system or exploit other bugs that may exist in Bash's command interpreter, if the attacker has a way to manipulate the environment variable list and then cause Bash to run. At the time the bug was discovered, Bash was installed on macOS and many Linux operating systems as the main command interpreter, so that any program that used the system function to run any other program would use Bash to do so.
Shellshock is a critical vulnerability due to the escalated privileges afforded to attackers, which allow them to compromise systems at will. Although the ShellShock vulnerability, CVE-2014-6271, was discovered in 2014, it is known to still exist on a large number of servers in the world. The vulnerability was updated (CVE-2014-7169) soon after and has been modified up until 2018.
The Shellshock flaw may be exploited without any authentication by adding arbitrary malicious code at the end of a specifically crafted Bash function. This technique could enable an attacker to gain command-line access to a system, which often results unrestricted access to run programs, filter through memory for sensitive data, or facilitate a self-propagating worm.

## A shellshocker is a type of malware that takes advantage of a security problem in the linux os.

Shellshock is a computer virus that exploits a vulnerability in the Bash shell, a common component of Linux and Unix-based operating systems. The virus was first discovered in September 2014, and has since been used to launch attacks against a wide range of targets, including government agencies, financial institutions, and media organizations.
^Although described in some sources as a "virus," Shellshock is instead a design flaw in a program that comes with some operating systems. See =Staff (25 September 2014). "What does the "Shellshock" bug affect?". The Safe Mac. Retrieved 27 September 2014.
When the CGI script launches Bash with the supplied environment parameters, it should trigger the execution of the echo command on a vulnerable system. With most scripts, the random string in the output of the echo command will be sent back in the body of the HTTP response, allowing the scanner to detect it and deem the system vulnerable. We deliberately picked the innocuous echo command as the one to execute by the scanner so as to minimize the chance of the scan doing anything harmful to the vulnerable target.
Please note that even a full internal and external IP range scan of your network will not provide you with a complete assurance that you are not vulnerable to Shellshock. In addition to the limitations of scanning CGI applications, this scanner is not able to determine the vulnerability of SMTP servers or DHCP clients to the bug. Nor is it able to be used to test for privilege escalation vulnerabilities via SSH or on local Unix and OSX systems. It is still paramount that you apply patches across your entire population of systems that utilize bash shell as soon as possible.
An indirect approach of analyzing program use of environment variables that could be leveraged across a security boundary is a possibility but I don’t have a high degree of confidence it would generate much other than a catalog of things to look at when analyzing other programs that execute child processes. For example if we found that ‘/bin/X’ could be crashed via environment input, then you might want a tool that scans source for any calls to X as a child process and a secondary tool that determines if external input can influence the environment at the time of the execution of X. Again, this is falling back to an implementation class bug that would throw an exception and be discoverable through traditional fuzzing. In the case of Bash even if we had a tool that did the above, we would not have found Shellshock because there is no defined exceptional condition (oracle problem).
In terms of inputs, there can exist well-formed and mal-formed examples of strings, numbers, filenames, arithmetic expressions, IP addresses, function definitions, assignment statements, etc. In the case of Shellshock there exist multiple vectors for the Shellshock vulnerability.
This set grows over time as application-specific issues are surfaces, e.g., a shell might have a problem with a fileneame beginning with “-” or “–“, since that syntax is reserved for an option name, so “-badfilename” is added to the class.
In this case for Shellshock, from , it is also useful to look at the final patch that came out which eliminated the external function execution ability of Bash. By seeing the code they patched, it gives us a clue as to characteristics of the code we should be checking and if we can generalize those characteristics then we can search other software as a starting point.
The Bug Bash flaw is particularly dangerous for Internet-of-Things devices like smart meters, routers, web cameras and any other device that runs software, which allows bash scripts. Typically, such software is not easy to fix and are more likely to expose the critical flaw in the Internet.
Testing Alternatives:
Unfortunately network-based scanning for vulnerable ShellShock servers is nowhere as easy as identifying the Heartbleed servers since the triggering of execution of the bash shell is usually very specific to each application. Even to effectively scan HTTP servers, one needs to know the path to all of the CGI scripts that are dependent on bash and sometimes even the specific GET or POST parameters that need to be supplied to the script in order to trigger the vulnerability. We have preloaded the scanner with almost 400 common CGI paths that will be attemped during the full scan and have allowed the import of additional paths to test custom or less popular CGI applications.
Heartbleed affected any system running OpenSSL, a common web encryption technology. With the Bash Bug, your system actually has to be using Bash. There are multiple types of command shells, so even if Bash is installed, the system could actually be using a different one.
