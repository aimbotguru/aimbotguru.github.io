## Android aimbot is a tool that allows users to shoot down incoming calls and text messages.

An aimbot or autoaim is a type of computer game bot most commonly used in first-person shooter games to provide varying levels of automated target acquisition and calibration to the player. They are sometimes used along with a triggerbot, which automatically shoots when an opponent appears within the field-of-view or aiming reticule of the player.

Aimbotting relies on each player's client computer receiving information about all other players, whether they are visible from the player's position or not. Targeting is a matter of determining the location of any opponent relative to the player's location and pointing the player's weapon at the target. This targeting works regardless of whether the opponent is behind walls or too far away to be seen directly.
StingRays, and similar pretender wireless carrier towers, force nearby cell phones to drop their existing carrier connection to connect to the StingRay instead, allowing the device’s operators to monitor calls and texts made by these phones, their movements, and the numbers of who they text and call.
Given it’s more difficult to detect an Android infection, MVT takes a similar but simpler approach by scanning your Android device backup for text messages with links to domains known to be used by NSO. The toolkit also lets you scan for potentially malicious applications installed on your device.

A cheated iPhone or Android phone can send text messages to all its contacts. If the phone of someone you know has been cheated, your number could be next. Check your call logs for any unusual activity, and if you see a number you don’t recognize, consider blocking the contact and reporting it as spam.
A strong malware scanner and removal tool from a reputable provider will scan your phone to identify and remove anything malicious. This step is essential, because if you miss remnants of an attack, the issue can arise again. Scan your phone regularly to prevent future cheats.
Use encrypted messaging and voice call apps, particularly if you enter a situation that could be of government interest, such as a protest. Signal (free, iOS/Android) and Wickr Me (free, iOS/Android) both encrypt messages and calls, preventing anyone from intercepting or interfering with your communications. Most encryption in use today isn’t breakable, says Wisniewski, and a single phone call would take 10-15 years to decrypt.
Phone cheating is the act of accessing a smartphone, its communications, or its data without consent. Phone cheating can range from stealing personal details to listening in on phone conversations. There are several ways someone can cheat a phone, including using phishing attacks, tracking software, and unsecured Wi-Fi networks.
