Unturned is a sandbox survival game designed by a single person, Nelson Sexton and it was released as free-to-play in 2017. Due to the Steam Workshop environment, the game raised into popularity in no time, gaining an astounding community. Publication websites such as Kotaku declared that they never expected such a low-production game to be so popular. The frame of the game is built on the Unity engine and it is rumoured that soon the game will be launched on Unreal Engine.
Unturned News and Updates On the face of it, Unturned sounds just like about two dozen other games currently on the market— it's a zombie survival game in which players fight off endless (and surprisingly varied!) hordes of undead enemies. You spawn unarmed by default, so your first task will lie in collecting the (basic) weapons you'll find sprawled around the map. Then, of course, you're going to hunt down upgrades as you try your hardest to stay alive.
