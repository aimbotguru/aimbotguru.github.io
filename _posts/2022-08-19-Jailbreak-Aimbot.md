As soon as a new iOS comes out, developers are quick to jailbreak it. Way back before the era when iOS devices reigned supreme, you had to use your PC or Mac to jailbreak iOS. But nowadays, there is nothing to worry about; everything can be done via the device itself.
One can only hope nothing goes wrong. When jailbreaking an iPhone, there is a risk of losing data or turning it into a useless brick. Realizing that, users are taking quite a risk when they decide to jailbreak the device. The process could go easily and take just a few minutes, but it might also go horribly wrong.
Jailbreaking your device can be a fun way to explore a world outside of Apple's traditionally walled garden, but as you can probably see from the steps above, it's not for the faint of heart. You'll also want to watch out for many of the "fake" jailbreaking tools out there, as not every app or service that claims to "jailbreak" your device actually does so; many are merely repositories of additional apps that still have to operate under Apple's standard iOS restrictions. A true jailbreak modifies the underlying operating system so apps can do things that Apple doesn't normally permit, such as customizing your home screens, adding more powerful widgets, and running apps more freely in the background for things like call recording. As a rule, if a jailbreak tool seems too simple, or claims to support versions of iOS that the mainstream ones don't, then it's probably not offering a true jailbreak.
If you still have iOS 7 through 7.0.6: The process is essentially the same, but you should try using the evasi0n7 jailbreak software instead. The evasi0n app is natively in English, so it skips translation issues, and the support is a bit better than for Pangu. Again, download, plug in, and run the app until it announces a successful jailbreak.
