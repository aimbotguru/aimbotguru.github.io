## How to fix an aimbot

So far since I've bought this game i've encountered two people who were clearly using an aimbot. They would do things like shooting through walls to kill special infected that hadn't even revealed themselves yet, or killing me the SECOND I spawned. I could tell it was unnatural from the way the camera was moving when I spectated. I would have just tried to kick them, but for some reason Valve thought it would be a good idea to ONLY let survivors kick survivors, and infected kick infected. And obviously the other team wasn't going to kick the person, as they were helping them win.
And regarding all these players talking about VAC, they have no idea what they are talking about. There are many cheats out there that will never get you VAC banned. However, aimbots might be the exception. There aren't any aimbot progs that are VAC safe to the best of my knowledge.
Having seen my fair share of cheats, cheats, suspicious players and those that are flat out not "clean" in their methods - what I can suggest is save yourself some grief and trouble with arguing/debating endlessly about whether something or someone is cheating in versus.. and just report it. Then move on.
Observe their movement. If its really twitchy, it might be aimbot. I was playing with some Brazilian guys and before the match started they were chatting and asked his friends, "Everyone have their aimbot on? Yeah? Ok, lets go". They then proceed in the map and owned left and right. Its been pretty apparent in VS lately.
It stays rather accurate while running and reverts to top accuracy very fast if you just stop running and crouch. This lets an experienced player kill long-range SI less than a second after they appear, and Hunters/Jockeys less than a second after they pin or ride a survivor. There is no need for aimbots to do that.
The two main weaknesses of the hunting rifle are the charger, which can withstand several shots unless you can somehow score a headshot, and the horde, which is hard to hit because of their tendency to medium-range lateral evasion. This is where you can usually determine if the player is using an aimbot or just very good - even the best players will be swamped by the horde if they have the hunting rifle in hand, while players with aimbot will just mow the horde down.
We don't have any footage of this, but be aware a lot of good players know in advance where infected will spawn, simply because they know how the diffrent skill levels play, and the instant you spawn you cause a lot of sound that gives away your position, making for easier location. The only way to really be sure is to spawn in as a hunter, behind a wall that offers no tactical benefit (since a normal player would not expect a spawn there) and if they shoot you then, the moment you spawn, then you can pretty confidently say that they're indeed cheating.if this person was really using an aimbot, then valve will handle it, if it was on a VAC-secured server.
Do you want to end your cruel life or got stuck somewhere and wanna enter spawn mode? Just type "kill" in the console and you will die instantly. Is there a player that's being a pain in everywhere? Then type "kill [player's name]". But it has to match the player's/NPC's name's case; so, to kill Bill, type "kill Bill". A side note is that you do not need to type the whole name; to kill Louis, for instance, you can simply type "kill L" and your work is done. This won't work if someone else has L at the beginning of their name, so just keep going until the name string is unique. Note that this is not efficient when hordes of tank spawn, so try kick Tank instead.
