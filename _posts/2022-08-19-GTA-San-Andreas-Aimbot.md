To earn easy weapon skill, go and get any two cars and place them in your Grove St home garage. Then with the weapon of your choice shoot the cars until they are nearly on fire. Then walk away from the garage so it can close. Walk up to the garage again and you will notice that the cars are repaired. Repeat this process as it is one of the fastest ways to earn weapon skill in the game. To check your progress with weapon skill, switch to the weapon that you want to check and then go to STATS in the menu and then go down to WEAPONS. The number there is how many skill points you have. You need 1000 skill points to reach hitman level.

Aron is responsible for the bulk of the news posts that you'll find on GTA BOOM each and every day. He loves getting involved with the community and is an avid fan of all things Rockstar Games. His journey with the franchise began with GTA 2 back when it was new (all the way back in 1999), and he was a gamer even before then. Graduating summa cum laude from Università degli Studi Guglielmo Marconi with a BA in Media Production, Aron has been a game journalist since 2014. When not writing, editing or playing, Aron is building models which you can find on Instagram.
This occurs when you are using an uncertified lightning to USB adapter. For Apple devices, it is highly recommended that you use original equipment, as most third-party equipment is unrecognized by Apple products. You can buy the official lightning to USB 3 camera adapter to connect your USB keyboard. It also comes with a charging port that can help power the keyboard (in case of lack of power).
Phil has been writing for PC Gamer for nearly a decade, starting out as a freelance writer covering everything from free games to MMOs. He eventually joined full-time as a news writer, before moving to the magazine to review immersive sims, RPGs and Hitman games. Now he leads PC Gamer's UK team, but still sometimes finds the time to write about his ongoing obsessions with Destiny 2, GTA Online and Apex Legends. When he's not levelling up battle passes, he's checking out the latest tactics game or dipping back into Guild Wars 2. He's largely responsible for the whole Tub Geralt thing, but still isn't sorry.

He is better known to many as ‘Mr Trophy’, due to his slightly unhealthy obsession with amassing intangible PlayStation silverware, and he now has over 450 Platinum pots weighing down the shelves of his virtual award cabinet. He does not care for Xbox Achievements.

## Gta san andreas cheats

In order to enter and activate cheat codes in GTA San Andreas, you must first select the cheat code you are looking to enter. With almost 100 cheats available on offer, you'll find cheats that range from infinite ammo, disabling your wanted level, infinite health, item and vehicle spawns, as well as plenty more.
Before you start using any GTA San Andreas cheats, you should make a save and ensure you keep it safe to return to later. This is because some of the effects they produce can become permanent, which may make further progress through the story difficult or even impossible without starting again from scratch. If you're on a recent version of the game then using Grand Theft Auto San Andreas cheats will also disable trophies or achievements, which obviously isn't desirable if you want to complete your collection of awards.
On this page, you'll find a complete list of all the cheat codes available to San Andreas players on PC as well as a tutorial on how to input them. So, without further ado, here are all of GTA San Andreas' PC cheat codes. Please note, this guide includes an update for the GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition release for Xbox, PC, and PS5.
The GTA: San Andreas cheats for the original game are a lot of fun—they let you play around with Rockstar's sandbox and unlock an arsenal of vehicles and weapons to use. San Andreas' lifestyle and fitness mechanics also added a lot of cheat potential, giving you the ability to never go hungry, gain infinite lung capacity, or strip yourself of fat and muscle.
The GTA San Andreas cheats provide a massive selection of codes to be used on the Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC versions of the game, giving you a huge amount of control over CJ and the world he inhabits. They enable you to access an unlimited supply of cash, guns, health, and armor, instantly achieve full respect to max out the size of your gang entourage, and become the master of all weapons without spending a second at the firing range. You can also get the police to turn a blind eye, spawn in a multitude of useful vehicles, or if you're feeling destructive you can give all the pedestrians weapons and let them duke it out in the streets.
PC cheats for GTA San Andreas are entered by simply typing the right word on the keyboard at any time. You don't need to bring up a console command mode or a dialog box, simply type the letters as they appear below, in lower case or upper case, and the cheat should activate.
There are a total of around 90 Grand Theft Auto San Andreas cheats available, which are accessed by pressing a string of buttons on your controller or typing a phrase on your keyboard, and most players won't be able to remember more than a couple of those at a time. That's why we're here to help, by providing a complete list of GTA San Andreas cheats split into relevant sections, so you can quickly locate the codes you need to start building your OG reputation.
As with most of Rockstar's sprawling open-world sandboxes, one of the best ways to have fun in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is to dip into its array of wacky cheat codes. Luckily, there's a whole bunch of them on offer, letting you spawn tanks, lead around groups of rocket-launcher-wielding pedestrians and even drive invisible cars.
