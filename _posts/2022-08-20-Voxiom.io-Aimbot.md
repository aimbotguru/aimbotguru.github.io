## Voxiom.io aimbot allows users to cheat in online games by using the bot to control the character.

I found a voxiom.io cheat client on greasyfork.org and i tried it once but very, VERY briefly, and tested a few things with a friend of mine, his username i won't tell, but i noticed a few very op effects, like the built in ESP, and Xray, that may be your problem.

His name is -voxiom_io-SLAY3R: https://voxiom.io/player/-voxiom_io-SLAY3R.Not so long time ago I played against him on CtG and noticed how strange he acts. Sometimes he's not doing much, judging by his match history but you can notice that he gets some big amount of kills. He was literally unstoppable for my team, I killed him once and that's it. He somehow was able to find one of the players despite this player was in random place underground. I mean, under blocks of sand. So I think this dude may be a cheater. I'm not fully sure but I think someone should investigate more and do something to this.
Uh-oh, so serious cheats for this game actually exist. I thought there wasn't way to make high quality cheats for Voxiom so that's why I wasn't fully sure about SLAY3R. Now I think he might be cheating, after all. But still, it could be just glitch on the spawn just like ClydeDaWonderDog said.
I am not familiar with WebGL enough to create something like chams, and I have not been able to find a player list yet.
If I can find a list of all players then I can create an ESP.
I haven't touched voxiom for a bit due to boredom, this could be a project for @xMiraiChan
