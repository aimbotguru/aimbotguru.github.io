## Minecraft java aimbot includes features such as jump prediction, wall jumping and firing while moving.

I can provide some examples of Click Aimbot/Triggerbot if you'd like. Unfortunately the TriggerBot ones would cause flame here seeing as they are videos of members in this community. I could probably post one of them, seeing as the player is already banned (not for the evidence I have, I never submitted it because it really wasn't enough but it's kind of fishy)

Jump - A feature I don't quite remember besides the fact that the popular client "Nodus" had it, this cheat allowed for editing your jump height to whatever you had wanted it to be. Often mistaken for Fly/Flight cheats, this was actually one of the more useless cheats and was mainly used for "the lolz" instead of for practicality as flight would do the exact same thing, but more accurately.
Fly - The typical cheat found in almost every client, which allows the client user to obtain flight. Mostly patched by NoCheatPlus there use to be plenty of bypass' (hitting yourself, using bed packets to fly, sprint flying, infinite jumping and I believe one other) this was one of the more saught after cheats/mods to bypass. This cheat is pretty self explanatory as it just allows the user to fly...

Enderport - This cheat I personally have only seen in one client, and it made it so when you got hit (or were about to get hit, something along those lines) you would be teleported behind said player. This cheat is mainly a PvP cheat, and because of its rarity i know nothing about it, but if you're hit, the teleportation would seem to work (assuming it follows the general rule that VClip does when you're hit).

Impact – A free client with built-in Baritone, an AI pathfinder bot that can automatically escape spawn and go to your desired co ordinates. It was made well known during the Rusher War after Rusher's advertisement and through eventual use of many 2b2t YouTubers. Impact has many modules that are useful on 2b2t for explorers, travelers, and builders.
Coordinate notation: Coordinates can be displayed in the game settings without enabling cheats.‌[Bedrock Edition only] The player can also record their base's coordinates from the Debug screen‌[Java Edition only] (this is done through F3 or Fn + F3, depending on BIOS settings). The coordinates are also reported when the player teleports using /teleport @s ~ ~ ~, and also copied to the clipboard in the form of /teleport when F3 + C is pressed, if cheats are enabled. A screenshot can be used or writing down, but the coordinates should be kept in a secure place. If the player does not want to write it down in real life or take a screenshot, they can craft a book and quill and write the coordinates of their home down there.
Future – A paid client advertised by Fit and several other 2b2t YouTubers. Future currently costs $20. Avoid any unofficial or "cracked" versions. Even though they can be downloaded for free, they are almost certainly backdoored and will leak your coordinates and maybe worse (IP, Passwords and Tokens).
Salcheat – A client made by Ionar2 which went open-source due to the unobfuscated jar being leaked. Currently has no developers and the Discord does not provide technical support for Salcheat either. Contains no XRay or search functions but is useful for beginner crystal combat.

## Minecraft java aimbot enables users to achieve a high level of accuracy when shooting.

General Summary: Click aimbot allows you to automatically hit the nearest entity within range of you every time you left-click with 100% accuracy. This gives the cheating player a major advantage as in normal combat both players miss a lot of the time when they swing their weapon. Forcefield is superior in every way, but people often use this weaker cheat instead because it's harder to spot and prove. The best way to tell if someone is using this cheat or not is to see if they're hitting you while angled away from you or straight up facing another direction. You also get hit slightly faster than normally possible by people using this cheat. Note that click aimbots do not affect bow accuracy.
How to identify: Aimbot is one of the more obvious cheats because the client is usually coded to aim at the nearest player and swing at maximum speed. If you see someone looking directly at or following your head (not always) in a fight it is most likely aimbot.
How cheaters like to hide it: Aimbot has the same adjustable settings as killaura above, however its more difficult to hide because it automatically aims for the head of the player. However there is a bypass to this rule, some clients allow to pick which part of the body the aimbot aims for, etc.
Most people will use the official Minecraft client to enjoy the game. However, some people may like to use a Minecraft cheated client to play the game. A Minecraft cheated client can give players unfair advantages over others in mini games or gamemodes for things like combat and basic movement.
Do not shoot these items. They count as entities, and as such, they can be hit off walls by arrows, using the arrow in the process. In fact, an armor stand is destroyed and does not drop as an item if shot. If the player wants to practice archery, the player should shoot somewhere else. A Target block is a much better option as it does not consume an arrow and can be linked to a Redstone Comparator to show more precise accuracy. A button made of wood can also serve as a nice and cheap target if the player does not have the resources to craft a target block. Stone buttons also work, but it's better to use the stone for something else unless you have a lot of stone.
Freecam- This acts as an "out of body experience" allowing the player to fly/wander around within their render distance without actually moving or being known that they are their. Sadly this is unpatchable as it is all client sided. This in conjunction to cavefinder helps cheaters find bases.
Specific Values, etc: Although this cheat is patched by the current versions of NCP players can turn off and on several settings such as lock view, which will allow the player's head to follow exactly where the other player is going. Some clients have a prediction, allowing the bow aimbot to predict where the player goes, I have no idea how it works so don't ask me.
How to identify: I have unfortunately seen many members of this community use this cheat, I'm not going to name people but I've seen it been used. Basically if you see someone who only swings their sword when the enemy is directly in front of them, it is most likely triggerbot.
