## Unreal engine aimbot – a way to cheat in unreal tournament

I had to download a few different versions of the cheat table until I found one that worked for my target game. Also it should be obvious but, don't learn UE game cheating on a game with an anti-cheat. You are setting up yourself for failure and hair loss. I attached the cheat table in the Tools directory if you want to download it. Here is the forum and downloads for the dumper. An awesome tutorial on the cheat table.

Hmm I don’t see myself as just a cheat/cheat coder. I’m interested in programming in general. It just happened that I started coding cheats because I was interested in how they worked. Now the challenge is beating the current anti cheat protections and exploring more bugs/exploits in the game. People may think we are unskilled fools, but it takes a lot of knowledge, research and logic to make a fully functional aimbot, and I don’t care about skills in a game. We still have fun when we play a game with or without cheats. I play RA2 against [ELF]Shaggy, and play Need for Speed underground clean.
But, was it done with an external program or in-game methods? I'm trying to eliminate mostly in-game exploits right now, though I'm very aware a lot of cheating is done with external cheat programs. The way I see it, with the source code I have I can fix many of the in-game cheats that most Unreal games have to a point where you don't need administrative intervention, it just can't be done anymore. Such as the multi-gunning exploit I discovered is quite possible in NAB and fixed thanks to gopostal's help.
Anyway, this is how my journey went: At first I didn't even have an idea whether Unreal Engine games need a special approach to cheat and as I learned, they definitely do. I read the forum about Unreal Engine Game Hacking on guidedcheating.com and honestly, it wasn't very good. Most of the stuff that I know now I taught myself because there really aren't many great tutorials for people starting out with Unreal Engine. As you read down below, I used a cheat engine table to find most of the structure offsets. It is more like a dumper because it automatically dumps the most important offsets like UWorld/GWorld and gives you a script with which you can easily reverse any class related to the game just like you can with the mono dissector in cheat engine. To enable this option, first run the Unreal Engine script in the cheat table, then turn on UE Structure Lookup. I personally wasn't very determined to find the ShootGun function, that's why the cheat doesn't have this option.
HAHA im still trying to work that out lads well basicly all of the above (Aimbots, Radar Hacks and Wallcheats) are cheats that will give u a advantage in the game that they are made for ie a radar will display a players location even if there across the other side of the map will all so show there health and there distance and the players name, aimbot well i know u all know wot that is but for the dumb ones ill enlighten u basicly makes me a god and ill win the match all the time,wall cheats are just lame make the dam game look ugly i dont like wall cheats at all.

I learned and did research that it’s possible for cheaters to very likely use the same cheating program in video games if they’re from the same engine. For example, an aimbot used in one Unreal Engine game can be easily tweaked and used in another but not in a Source game.
You should take a special approach to cheating UE games. As you will read in many other tutorials, you will need to find most importantly UWorld AKA GWorld which has all of the game information you could ever need. This is often referred to as UWolrd but it's actually called GWorld, UWorld is the class name in the UE Source Code. You will also often stumble across GNames and GObjects, GNames contains all of the class names basically, you definetly need GNames if you want to make something more than just a simple value cheat. You will find a function in my source called mem::GetGName() which will show you how to use GNames, it is located in UnrealEngine/Utils.cpp. GObjects is an array just like GNames, it also can be accessed similarly to GNames, however I don't have a function for that in my project. GObjects holds the addresses to all types that the game uses at least as far as I understood it.
Aimbots: There are 2 types of aimbots.
1) External Aimbots that don’t use the game engine’s code to determine where an enemy is located. Most of them scan the screen for a specific color and will try to move the mouse to that position. This type of aimbot is highly inaccurate.
Cheat Engine is a classic no matter what game you are cheating. The thing that helped me by far the most is the UE4 Win64 Base Table for Cheat Engine though. It lets you find your local player and UWorld literally within a single click. The other thing that's really useful is the UE Structurue Lookup script in the table. It lets you view the game/unreal engine structures in a really nice format just like Mono Dissector. I used the latest version of the tool right now which is v6.9.

## Unreal engine aimbot – how to use

Needless to say, you need an IDE to compile your project (cheat) so I used VS22. I personally didn't use Unreal Finder Tool all that much but you can use it for finding GNames, GObjects and generating an SDK as well as dumping GNames, GObjects (dumping in the sense of getting all of the names and objects, not the offset of GNames and GObjects).
In-game, press the ~ key (it's the key above the TAB key on your keyboard). This should give a small line at the bottom of the game screen in which you can type commands. If you type the ~ again you'll get a larger console window which also shows the response of the game on your commands.
This seems very interesting, but I don't know how to use it or what games to use it on. Could someone post an example? Something like "I hook into Batman: Arkham Asylum (which is a UE4 game I think), expand the 'UE4 entry, and click on 'Basic UE Object dumper'. Then I see there's a class called 'Script/Batmobile' and I click on X and do Y and now it's invulnerable." Or not even a full cheat, but how this would be used to dissect a structure you found a pointer to some other way. Can it tell what type you are pointing to and provide the structure? Do you just have to click those two things for that to happen automatically, or do you have to do something else?
Also, it should go without saying but you will have an easier time understanding any of this if you've got some programming experience but I will try to explain things in such a way that you don't need to be an expert in order to walk away from this introduction with some very useful UE4 game cheating knowledge.Part 1 - Very Basic Understanding Of Different Types Of UObjects
After you've successfully injected the dll, you'll get a series of notification windows in the top left corner of your game window which some info regarding what the UUU is doing. You can now switch to the Available features tab to see which features of the UUU are available with the game you're using it with.
I emailed the files to you. One zip is the mod and ini and the other zip is the source. Don't get hung up if you try to read the source and it looks messed up. It's written that way on purpose to pass properly through the obfuscator. Once I show you how to filter it in notepad++ you'll be able to read it easily.
Now you first start the game and when the game has opened its main menu, you start the UuuClient.exe application to inject the UniversalUE4Unlocker.dll into the game's process and control its features. To do so, on the General tab you click the Select... button and select the game's process. You can leave the 'DLL to inject' as-is as it should already refer to the UniversalUE4Unlocker.dll.
Most settings are for the built-in free camera and are self explanatory. The Game control device allows you to select which device to use for controlling the built-in free camera. By default it's both 'keyboard+mouse' and 'gamepad'. The device that's chosen is blocked by default to send its input to the game (as much as possible, sometimes this is unavoidable).
