## Unreal engine aimbot

Needless to say, you need an IDE to compile your project (cheat) so I used VS22. I personally didn't use Unreal Finder Tool all that much but you can use it for finding GNames, GObjects and generating an SDK as well as dumping GNames, GObjects (dumping in the sense of getting all of the names and objects, not the offset of GNames and GObjects).

Anyway, this is how my journey went: At first I didn't even have an idea whether Unreal Engine games need a special approach to cheat and as I learned, they definitely do. I read the forum about Unreal Engine Game Hacking on guidedcheating.com and honestly, it wasn't very good. Most of the stuff that I know now I taught myself because there really aren't many great tutorials for people starting out with Unreal Engine. As you read down below, I used a cheat engine table to find most of the structure offsets. It is more like a dumper because it automatically dumps the most important offsets like UWorld/GWorld and gives you a script with which you can easily reverse any class related to the game just like you can with the mono dissector in cheat engine. To enable this option, first run the Unreal Engine script in the cheat table, then turn on UE Structure Lookup. I personally wasn't very determined to find the ShootGun function, that's why the cheat doesn't have this option.
You should take a special approach to cheating UE games. As you will read in many other tutorials, you will need to find most importantly UWorld AKA GWorld which has all of the game information you could ever need. This is often referred to as UWolrd but it's actually called GWorld, UWorld is the class name in the UE Source Code. You will also often stumble across GNames and GObjects, GNames contains all of the class names basically, you definetly need GNames if you want to make something more than just a simple value cheat. You will find a function in my source called mem::GetGName() which will show you how to use GNames, it is located in UnrealEngine/Utils.cpp. GObjects is an array just like GNames, it also can be accessed similarly to GNames, however I don't have a function for that in my project. GObjects holds the addresses to all types that the game uses at least as far as I understood it.
I learned and did research that it’s possible for cheaters to very likely use the same cheating program in video games if they’re from the same engine. For example, an aimbot used in one Unreal Engine game can be easily tweaked and used in another but not in a Source game.

The first major feature of the new MetaHuman Plugin for Unreal Engine, Mesh to MetaHuman, enables you to take your own custom facial mesh and convert it into a MetaHuman, fully rigged and ready to animate. You can even further refine your character in MetaHuman Creator.
IDA Pro, also another classic in game cheating. What you will use it for is finding offsets + functions and reversing game functions. I personally had no problem finding ANY Unreal Engine function with IDA Pro. Like for example UObject::ProcessEvent(). The best way to find Unreal Engine functions/offsets is to download the Unreal Engine version your game uses and then build a simple game with it. The magic is in the .pdb which Unreal Engine can generate. If you open the generated game exe with its linked pdb, all the Unreal Engine functions will be named. Then you can simply go to the function you want to find, copy the opcodes and signature scan them in IDA in the other game. As you will see in this project, I used patterns/sigantures too. Here is a specific tutorial on that.
It's time to dive into memory and have a look at what exists at these UObject addresses.
I generally recommend that you set your Cheat Engine memory viewer up to display values as 8-byte hex and lock it to 2 columns for an easier time looking at and navigating UObjects.
Unreal Engine includes full access to the complete C++ source code. To access source code on GitHub, you'll need to have a GitHub account, and you'll need to link it to your Epic Games account. Refer to this page for full instructions. If you're a custom licensee, you also have the option to access the source code via Perforce; you should have received information about this during your onboarding. If you're not a custom licensee, contact us if you're interested in finding out more about the benefits.

Get Unreal Engine here, and access all engine features, the full suite of integrated tools, and the C++ source code for the entire engine. You’ll find documentation, tutorials, and support resources, plus tons of free content, including templates, samples, and complete projects to quickly get you on your way to building anything you want!
You will need a Windows or macOS computer with internet access and a Chrome, Edge (Chromium), Firefox, or Safari web browser. You will also need an Epic Games account. To download your MetaHumans, you will need to use Quixel Bridge, which is now integrated into Unreal Engine 5. If you're still using UE4, download the free standalone Bridge application.
Cheat Engine is a classic no matter what game you are cheating. The thing that helped me by far the most is the UE4 Win64 Base Table for Cheat Engine though. It lets you find your local player and UWorld literally within a single click. The other thing that's really useful is the UE Structurue Lookup script in the table. It lets you view the game/unreal engine structures in a really nice format just like Mono Dissector. I used the latest version of the tool right now which is v6.9.
I had to download a few different versions of the cheat table until I found one that worked for my target game. Also it should be obvious but, don't learn UE game cheating on a game with an anti-cheat. You are setting up yourself for failure and hair loss. I attached the cheat table in the Tools directory if you want to download it. Here is the forum and downloads for the dumper. An awesome tutorial on the cheat table.
Yes, and we have designed the Unreal Editor and launcher to accommodate this. We aim to build a unified development and modding community. Here is how this works: You’re free to release your game through any distribution channels of your choosing, however the Unreal Editor (including modified versions) and code may only be distributed through official Epic channels (e.g. the UE4 launcher for binaries, and GitHub for source), to users who have accepted the EULA.
Unreal Engine 5 is the latest generation of Unreal Engine, a complete suite of creation tools for game development, architectural and automotive visualization, linear film and television content creation, broadcast and live event production, training and simulation, and other real-time applications.
I wasn't able to implement Silent Aim in this project, because it's an offline game which means that you have hook the trace line function and modify its output of it in order to have an actual silent aim, however in all modern online games that's not done on the player's client meaning that the only way to have silent aim in an online game is through sending/spoofing the view angles that are sent to the server. The server then will traceline based on those angles meaning you will hit the enemy on the server although you really shouldn't if done properly. The 2 functions you want to look at for Silent Aim are ULocalPlayer::GetViewPoint() and APlayerController::GetPlayerViewPoint(). Those functions return information about where the local player is looking and by hooking them you can make silent aim in most online games. However there is no guarantee it will work for your target game. Here is some more information about that. So, back to offline games, you can't simply hook a traceline function first of all because there are many different Unreal Engine functions that your game might be using so you will actually need to reverse the game and find the ShootGun function where you will see what trace line function the game uses. Then you have to hook the ShootGun function and set a boolean in the program to true. In your trace line hook you then check if that boolean is true, if it is true you know that the function was called by the ShootGun function and from there you can return a false hit to simulate silent aim. Here is a related tutorial.
Purpose:
The purpose is mostly to demonstrate how a cheat could be made on any Unreal Engine game in 64bit very quickly, even given the lack of references/info around (on most titles, UE4 is fairly popular though). There's not much stealth or other methods applied here.
