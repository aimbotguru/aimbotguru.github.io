This is a subreddit for War Thunder, a cross platform vehicular combat MMO developed by Gaijin Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S.

In Gaijin Entertainment's 2012 combat-sim War Thunder, players can seamlessly integrate numerous mods into the game, allowing for a truly personalized experience when competing in online multiplayer. Among these mods, this list outlines some of the best.
Is there a way to cheat in War Thunder?Certainly, yes. There are certain programs that will allow you to see opponents regardless of distance and terrain and there are auto aiming and chasing scripts, also called “aimbots” that allow you to automatically stick to a target in dogfights / tank /sea fights and aim at them. These kinds of cheating tools once Downloaded will allow you to dominate the battlefield in Tanks, Ships and in the Air. However, there are NO god modes, Silver Lions addes, Golden Eagle generators or similar.
Gaijin, the team behind War Thunder, has become known for being unwelcome with criticism. They’ve issued DMCA take-downs of community-created gameplay videos, sued YouTubers for uploading content that criticizes them, and blacklisted players from their official forums for reporting bugs in their game.
Cheats in War Thunder are mostly ways and techniques that allow you to get more silver lions, experience and unlocks in a shorter amount of time. There are ways to do this that are achievable manually, such as exploits and farming techniques and there are some cheats that require software in order to be achieved, such as ESPcheats, aim bots and farming bots. Generally cheating in this game will allow you to progress through the unlocks and levels much faster and allow you to save some money. War Thunder can be quite a grind and that’s why most pros and serious players are using some kind of cheat in order to keep on top of the competitive War Thunder scene. There are no Cheat Codes in this game, since cheating is not an intended part of the game experience. It also need to be noted that important values in this MMO are processed on the game server and cannot be changed through cheats.

Before starting, players will have to take note that gameplay mods are usually not allowed. War Thunder is a competitive online-only game, meaning anything that alters the gameplay or even some parts of the user interface can be considered cheating. Hence, most mods players are allowed to install are skins and cosmetics. Follow these steps:
In every MMO there are certain values that cannot possibly be changed ever. These values are usually very important values that are part of the game economy and the way the game is monetized. In War Thunders these values include your level, health, plane unlocks, experience, golden eagles and silver lions. These values are not processed on your PC and can therefore not be changed using any cheats or generators. Anyone telling you otherwise is probably trying to scam you by either selling you bad software, letting you fill in surveys, stealing your login info or letting you download viruses. So please do not fall for these lazy scams. If these values were cheatable, the game would die within weeks, since everyone would use the cheat and the game would stop being fun and competitive in any way.
Most of the time, War Thunder has to sacrifice some historical accuracy in order to make gameplay more fun. Additionally, some censorship concerns are ever-present regarding certain notorious symbols. But if games find themselves craving for a more historically accurate representation of their favorite factions, then World War II Countries Paints does a good job. It's a collection of 12 faction paints which the author feels best constitutes the elements of known history.
The game that comes out on top in this discussion is the one that appeals to your personal preference. World of Tanks, in fitting with its more arcade-like action, is slightly more cartoonish in its designs and animations. For War Thunder, it’s the tiny details that help build immersion. Things like the way mud stick to your tank as the battle progresses — and you can wash it off by wading into a river!

Aimbots are essentially software programs that will allow you to activate an auto-aim function that will aim for you and even shoot without your input, making kills much easier. Usually these programs will allow you to map a key to the auto aiming and all you do is to hold down that key in order to lock on to an enemy and shoot them. Obviously your aim is still limited by how fast your plane/tank/shit can maneuver. Aimbots work for ground battles, air battles and sea battles alike, since the aiming is almost the same for all of these. Aimbots usually inject code into the game and are therefore potentially detectable and can get your account get banned if you use software that is outdated, so please make sure that the software you are using is up to date before using it live or subscribe to a paid cheat. Aimbots can be quite unfair towards other players and we advise our members to use them with caution in order to not annoy too many people and avoid harming their game experience.
For ground forces its not really a conspiracy. There really is an aimbot that works for tanks, the main part of the tank is separate from the turret, which is the reason they can work in tanks and not work for planes. The other problem that comes in is ULQ (Ultra Low Quality). Some people confuse that with cheats when its not. Just dont expect to use the aimbot for long as Gaijin will catch you and will perma ban you as they should. Though they are rare in War Thunder though. Yes some are good and able to do it.
Aimbots in Ground Forces vs. Sea Forces vs. Air BattlesWhile the aimbots in War Thunders air battles will mostly help you to stick to your target effectively and do a part of the aiming for you, in Tank and Ship Battles, the aiming can be done a lot more accurately. In WT Ground Forces arcade battles, the aimbot is able to not only able to aim at enemies, but also to aim at their weakest spots, allowing you to get one shot kills in many cases. In simulation or even historic battles the bot will have to be configured in order to do the same job, since there is no accurate hit indicator. Overall you should the aimbot to be most effective in arcade battles land, sea and air. Also the aimbot will be more effective in tank vs. tank battles than in air or land engagements. However, due to the very realistic oriented nature of the game, aimbots will never be able to be perfect. After all computers are not 100% accurate at aiming either when it comes to real world application.
For planes aimbot was made with aiming inversion, wich adds faster turn to target, in addition movement prediction markers have correction for guns targeting aim (known parallax effect).This cheat mod also have alternative own bomb aim for planes, bomb aim works on all types of aircraft.
Aimbots absolutely exist, the game pumps out all the info they need it's just masked in RB. They are just of severely limited use in air battles. Turrets on a bomber would be the exception, but the only time they would work would be if you are flying in a straight line. Probably a disadvantage to try to use one in a dogfight, it would only be a distraction.
