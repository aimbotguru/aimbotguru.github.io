## War thunder aimbot - how to use an aimbot.

Aimbots are essentially software programs that will allow you to activate an auto-aim function that will aim for you and even shoot without your input, making kills much easier. Usually these programs will allow you to map a key to the auto aiming and all you do is to hold down that key in order to lock on to an enemy and shoot them. Obviously your aim is still limited by how fast your plane/tank/shit can maneuver. Aimbots work for ground battles, air battles and sea battles alike, since the aiming is almost the same for all of these. Aimbots usually inject code into the game and are therefore potentially detectable and can get your account get banned if you use software that is outdated, so please make sure that the software you are using is up to date before using it live or subscribe to a paid cheat. Aimbots can be quite unfair towards other players and we advise our members to use them with caution in order to not annoy too many people and avoid harming their game experience.

Our War Thunder Aimbot comes with all the features required to win every battle, not matter if it is naval, aerial or ground. Marks such as Target Lock will keep your crosshair on the enemy until it is dead. Or if you are trying to clean up your enemies fast, Auto-Switch is the way to go as you will change your aim-assist automatically to the next target once your previous one is dead. TriggerBot is very important in this game also, as it will fire automatically if the enemy is within your range of fire. Other items: Magic Bullet, Lock on, Prediction, Smoothness, Visibility check and many more.

Aimbots in Ground Forces vs. Sea Forces vs. Air BattlesWhile the aimbots in War Thunders air battles will mostly help you to stick to your target effectively and do a part of the aiming for you, in Tank and Ship Battles, the aiming can be done a lot more accurately. In WT Ground Forces arcade battles, the aimbot is able to not only able to aim at enemies, but also to aim at their weakest spots, allowing you to get one shot kills in many cases. In simulation or even historic battles the bot will have to be configured in order to do the same job, since there is no accurate hit indicator. Overall you should the aimbot to be most effective in arcade battles land, sea and air. Also the aimbot will be more effective in tank vs. tank battles than in air or land engagements. However, due to the very realistic oriented nature of the game, aimbots will never be able to be perfect. After all computers are not 100% accurate at aiming either when it comes to real world application.

Aim Assist is a feature that allows players to keep the scope or crosshair on the enemy. It helps you target the enemy and land shots more accurately. This feature is often built into games that are designed for consoles. Aimbot on the other hand is a cheat that allows players to aim for the head and never miss. This is essentially cheating.
The Reason why EAC doesn't catch this is because this cheat is actually a ingame mechanic. The setting target tracking is modified so it works as an aimbot. Same story with the lead indicator from Arcade AIR used for tanks in Ground RB, combined with target tracking and voila, aimbot. (source was a russian twitch stream)
Use of ESPHacks and Aimbots in Historic and Simulator BattlesWe do urge our members not to use aimbots and ESP cheats in historic or simulator battles. These game modes are made to experience the non-gamy version of this World War 2 simulator and cheating is something gamy, right? Aimbots and ESP cheats are very overpowered in sim and historic matches, as you might imagine and using them will cause a lot more damage to the game experience of other players than if you do it in arcade battles. So please for the good of War Thunder, the gaming community and the peace, do not cheat in these battles. In arcade the people you shoot down will respawn in a few seconds, but here they won’t and they will be quite annoyed. Beside that, historic and sim battles are not popular enough as it is and we really do not want to see them go away entirely. You cheat in game, not in simulations. These simulations are more of a historic-nostalgic experience, than they are a game.
In Warzone, for example, aim assist is on by default when playing on a controller and it will help you hit enemies. Aim assist helps you track enemies better so that you can land hits on the body and the head. Aimbot is always going to aim for the head so that you can take out the enemy in a shot or two.
