## World of tanks aimbot.

The use of "VANGA AimBOT" brings comfort and a tangible advantage in combat to a dishonest player and causes justifiable irritation in his opponents. Indeed, in fact, World of Tanks, as a team tactical multiplayer shooter, is built primarily on shooting and skill in this area. "VANGA AimBOT" allows you to play without thinking about aiming, taking on the entire complex part of the gameplay - it is focused on the enemy's tank, targets the most vulnerable zones of the enemy's tank and even takes a lead when shooting at moving vehicles! The player literally does not need to think about the game or keep in mind the characteristics of the enemy's tanks - the sight does everything for him. All that is required of the player is only to direct the weapon into the area nearby from enemy tanks, and then the sight will capture it and take all the work on itself.

Hacks are pieces of software that injects code into the game client in order to add functionality that would not otherwise be available in the stock version of the game. One of the most overpowered cheats in WoT is the ESPcheat (ESP= Extrasensory Perception). This kind of cheat allows you to display enemy positions at all time (spotted or not) and will make outmaneuvering them and shooting them a lot easyer. ESPcheats will show you the enemy through walls, show their distance and their health if configured correctly. Aimbots are another very effective kind of cheat in World of Tanks. Aim bots is software that will automatically aim and in some cases even shoot for you at the press of one single button. Aimbots can be set to shoot for weak points in the enemy armor and and avoid shooting surfaces that are likely to ricochet or fail to penetrate. Aimbots are fairly popular among pro WoT players, since shooting the right weak points and the points with the highest chance to penetrate is fairly important in higher tier matches. And as you might imagine using gold ammo (premium ammo) along with an aimbot is quite overpowered. However, you will do very well using normal penetrating and explosive ammo as well.
World of Tanks bots are programs that will take control of your account and perform automated tasks. Bots can be quite effective at farming silver and experience and will let you unlock higher-tier tanks a lot faster if used right. Especially at the lower levels of play (low tier battles) bots can be quite effective, since the repair costs are not as high. While the best scripts are pretty proficient at fighting, most automated farming software will use scout and light tanks in order to spot enemies and earn experience and silver that way. But even the scripts that are able to fight will get less effective, as you progress through the tiers. Also bots will require you to either have huge piles of silver or gold, since the silver earned will not always exceed the repair costs and ammo consumption. This is probably the biggest difference between WoT bots and other game bots: WoT bots can actually make you lose money if they are not configured correctly. Bots will generally allow you to skip most of the grind involved in playing WoT is a serious manner. However, configuring them correctly might take some time.
As we previously established, cheats are able to detect if people have vision on you or are aiming at you, now while displaying warnings is very helpful, it does not necessarily save your life in a combat situation. So hat some very clever World of Tank cheaters have done it to create software that will not only detect if people are aiming at you, but will also react to it automatically. These tools will automatically detect where an enemy is located and at what angle he is most likely to shoot you, then angle your tank in such a way that there is a higher chance for the projective to bounce. Now obviously there is still some randomness involved in the penetration vs ricochet process, but statistically this kind of software will save you at least 50% of your health when you get hit overall. However, the use of anti-penetration tools comes with its downsides as well: While the bot is re-angling your tank, it will be hard for you to aim, since you have no control over your vehicles movements during the process and then the obvious fact that not all tanks have the same plating / armor and the same geometry. This kind of cheat works best with the kind of tank that has all around decent armor and no obvious and huge weak points. While this kind of cheating method has certainly been used in the history of World of Tanks, it has never been made publicly available for everyone to use. We do however suspect that there are private groups of fairly competitive players that keep the software up to date and use it in competitive WoT play. However, no one can be certain, since the software is literally undetectable by any means is based on memory reading and not DLL injection. Maybe one day we will get our hands on this very exciting cheat.
Well 321_zero.... I can probably say, These kids shooting you down are probably the ones that's running the cheats your talking about. Have seen it before in different games. They come to the forums and call people liars when in fact they themselves are doing the cheating. Have seen first hand the wall cheat one your talking about. Being able to see thru buildings and rocks the tank your fighting and which way he is turning or pointing. Have run into a few games that a few of the players seem questionable. UNTIL WG decides to put a wall of shame page and let the players know who these cheaters and liars are..... It will continue. IF YOU have to cheat in a free to play game JUST to see your name in pixel lights that could vanish with the push of a key....You're the one that needs to .... git gud But of course.... WG could be behind a lot of it, They created a game..... Then create cheats to go with the game... sell the cheats online, fail to put up a page calling out cheaters.... They would make double their money that way.

Do some players use aimbots and other cheats? Yes they do however it's a small minority of individuals. I'd like to think that the majority of people who accuse others or cheating are not very good at the game. They use the terms cheats as an excuse for their poor performances during game play.
The Autoaim feature is one of the first things all tank commanders learn when they begin their journey in World of Tanks. Many hold different opinons about Autoaim; some feel that it's a waste of time, while others swear by its effectiveness in every battle.
Bots are in their essence not detectable, since they generate user input and do not inject or change code in the game client. However, if other players are able to tell that you are a bot, then you might still get reported to the game mods manually and your account might still be in danger. However, looking natural in WoT is pretty easy, since players do the silliest things anyways. But as always we recommend that you do not farm 24/7, but turn off your bot for at least 3h a day to make sure you cannot be detected by server-side bot detection.

## World of tanks cheat.

Is there any Way to Cheat in World of Tanks?Yes, there are ways of getting an unfair advantage in WoT. On one hand you have scripts that will automatically play matches for you and farm silver, and you have aimbots that will automatically aim your guns at enemies visible to you. However, there are NO Silvercheats, gold adders, XP cheats or anything of that sort.
Its funny how many people will tell you the game is server side so there is no way people can cheat. well that is a load of crap, and the people shoveling that crap are more then likely all using cheats. go to youtube and watch some of the WoT videos there, you can see players when they go to their zoom, they have a little dot that tells them where to shoot a tank to pen or crit, that is a cheat, then there are the people that tell you, you get spotted when tanks are 50 meters away, well I have had my light bulb go off letting me know I have been spotted 3 seconds into the game well I am behind a building at the starting point, that's a view cheat. now there are other cheat or cheats out there, but the devs are not really going to do anything about them as they are probably the ones selling them online. but it is very simple, the losers that use the cheats will one day know how pathetic they are and will pick up a gun, put it in their mouths and pull the trigger, and the sooner the better as far as I am concerned.
In every MMO game there are certain things, values and currencies that must not be cheatable in order to keep the game running. These kinds of data are not processed on the user’s PC, but the game server. In World of Tanks these kinds of values include: Your tank unlocks, your gold, health, experience, research, premium ammo, your silver (credits) and your ammo as well. All these values cannot possibly be changed by any kind of client-side software, since this data is processed and stored on the WoT servers. Imagine if it was possible to get Unlimited HP in World of Tanks: In a matter of days every player and their dog will use this exploit and the game would stop being fun, since everyone has unlimited health and the game is doomed. Everyone claiming to own some kind of software that allows you to change any of these values is a scammer. – These people will want to have you fill in surveys, click monetized links or give them your login data. So do not fall for it, please. You have now been warned.
Of course, there is, or used to be, lots of "cheating" in World of Tanks. We are not talking about cheating the server but cheating on the client-side through the use of mods. Many ignorant people think you cannot cheat on a server-side game but ... whenever you allow mods, you allow the possibility of cheating to a certain degree. I have even used some of these mods back in the day before they were banned because I did not think it was possible. Now I use no mods, nothing at all. I play WoT vanilla. The mod Tundra I tried, that is now banned, used to take away the foliage (trees, bushes, plants, etc) and you could see everybody that was "hiding" in plain sight. Another mod, Lasers, put a "laser" in all the enemy guns so you could see where they were aiming. Handy to know when you are going to get hit before you get hit. It also allows you to pop out from behind cover and shoot someone while their gun is pointing away. The most referred to, or complained about mod, is the "aimbot". Once you "lock" onto the target with the "aimbot" key, it moves your aiming reticle to the place you should fire to hit the target. Handy if you want to hit a moving target like a light tank. Certain "aimbots" even "auto-aim" at soft spots like fuel tanks, ammo racks, etc. Certain mods provide skins to indicate where you should fire to do damage to certain modules or crew members. Taking out the loader increases the reload time. Taking out any crew member "cancels" the Brothers in Arms perk until he is revived.
The existence of cheats for the game World of Tanks has been heard, if not by the majority, then certainly by many players. And if not so many players know about some highly specialized ones, then certain names at one time made quite a splash. Such big names include the "TundraSky" package and "VANGA AimBOT - cheating auto sight for World of Tanks 1.17.1.3" - probably the most famous cheating sight.
what is the best cheat mod that these [edited]are using? the one's that let you shoot thru a building or solid rocks, or can spot you behind everything. or the one that targets every module on your tank??? or the one that makes you invisible while 10 feet in front of you? or the one that lets you sit all the way in the back of the map and just snipe and get 10, 15, 20 kills before even being spotted??? yea, I need that one to even play with some of these guys. like warship's cheaters that do the same thing. yea, that's why I don't give Ivan any of my hard earned money like some of these [edited]. 1 cheater per game is ok but when you get 5 or 8 per round it sucks. yea I want that cheat to have fun with World of Tanks.
Cheats in World of Tanks are mostly ways and techniques used to farm more Experience, Silver and Gold or to automate certain actions in order to make your gameplay more effective. Most cheating methods in this game, such as ESPcheats, aimbots or farming bots, require software in order to work and cannot be achieved manually. Obviously, since this in a multiplayer game, there are no cheat codes, since cheating is not an intended part if the game experience. Cheats can either be achieved manually (mostly exploits) or through the use of software, such as cheats or bots. While cheats can accelerate your progression in WoT, they cannot possibly let you skip it completely. Especially at the higher levels of play, even bots are not able to farm silver effectively due to high repair costs and you might still have to grind manually using aimbots. However, at the highest level of play in World of Tanks, cheating is pretty common. Most of the world’s best players are using one script or another in order to increase their performance in the game.
How much do World of Tanks Bots or Cheats cost?You are looking at around 10 to 20USD per month for most bots and cheats. There may also be free stuff out there, but that usually gets detected within days and may get your account banned before you even start getting benefits.
