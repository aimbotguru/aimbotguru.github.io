## World of tanks aimbot is a program that allows players to control their tanks without having to use the keyboard.

As the name suggests, an aimbot is a cheating program, that allows you – even without any knowledge of the tanks – to target tank weakspots. It works essentially as a normal auto-aim, only using different reference points for each tank. Basically, you can select to target specifical armor weakspots, such as commander’s cupola, or for example the driver’s hatch on frontal armor. Alternatively, you can make the aimbot target specific modules, such as ammo rack, engine, fuel tanks and such. This selection happens (or can happen) using a single button, that “cycles” the target modules/areas.

Auto aiming technology is pretty new in mobile games. While it has been used in games on PC and consoles for decades, the World of Tanks Blitz aimbot is now more than just a possibility. It is the most powerful cheat for the game at this time in fact. Auto aiming apps in general allow you to bind a button (usually a new custom touch-button on your screen) to the auto aiming and shooting (triggerbot) function. Once you hold down the button, the script will lick on to the closest target, aim for areas with highest chance for penetration and trigger your shot. The aimbot is especially powerful in World of Tanks Blitz, since it is not just about shooting the enemy, but hitting them where it hurts, considering angles of the armor, avoiding ricochet / bounces, finding spots with thin armor, hitting the ammo rack ect. For a player it is very hard to keep track of all the tanks, their armor, their weak points and then reacting quickly to hit the right spot to do max DMG in the heat of a fight and using the very clunky mobile controls for movement and aiming. However, for a script that is not a problem at all.
Games like first and third-person shooters are some of the most popular video games and are sometimes associated with the use of aimbots. An aimbot is a cheat that enhances precision in aiming in video games. Familiarizing yourself with how aimbots work will ensure that you hit every target and come out on top of your match rankings.
It's not aimbot, but the type where they afk and mindlessly follow their nearest ally and proceed to shoot regardless of position when red tanks are within their view range. It's hard to give you an example, but I believe that some of you who play at HK server around midnight (UTC +8) will witness one or two tanks behave this way every five or six games. Typically, they have impossible Win Rate of 39-41% and when they move in game, they look like a confused tier 1 playing their first game, even if they are using non premium mid-high tier tank.
Aimbots are basically game bots that automatically lock a player’s cursor to their opponents in order to improve their target accuracy and speed. An aimbot gives players superhuman reflexes and abilities that match or exceed those of the best pro players. Aimbots use game memory to access and detect information such as the position and visibility of other players, and this makes them function more effectively.

The use of "VANGA AimBOT" brings comfort and a tangible advantage in combat to a dishonest player and causes justifiable irritation in his opponents. Indeed, in fact, World of Tanks, as a team tactical multiplayer shooter, is built primarily on shooting and skill in this area. "VANGA AimBOT" allows you to play without thinking about aiming, taking on the entire complex part of the gameplay - it is focused on the enemy's tank, targets the most vulnerable zones of the enemy's tank and even takes a lead when shooting at moving vehicles! The player literally does not need to think about the game or keep in mind the characteristics of the enemy's tanks - the sight does everything for him. All that is required of the player is only to direct the weapon into the area nearby from enemy tanks, and then the sight will capture it and take all the work on itself.
Hacks are pieces of software that injects code into the game client in order to add functionality that would not otherwise be available in the stock version of the game. One of the most overpowered cheats in WoT is the ESPcheat (ESP= Extrasensory Perception). This kind of cheat allows you to display enemy positions at all time (spotted or not) and will make outmaneuvering them and shooting them a lot easyer. ESPcheats will show you the enemy through walls, show their distance and their health if configured correctly. Aimbots are another very effective kind of cheat in World of Tanks. Aim bots is software that will automatically aim and in some cases even shoot for you at the press of one single button. Aimbots can be set to shoot for weak points in the enemy armor and and avoid shooting surfaces that are likely to ricochet or fail to penetrate. Aimbots are fairly popular among pro WoT players, since shooting the right weak points and the points with the highest chance to penetrate is fairly important in higher tier matches. And as you might imagine using gold ammo (premium ammo) along with an aimbot is quite overpowered. However, you will do very well using normal penetrating and explosive ammo as well.
Plus it’s not like it’s hard to make an aimbot, WG practically made out for players to use.
All the modders had to do was tweak it to aim at specific spots and tweak it to have lead using the speed and spatial coordinates of the target to calculate it properly. You don’t even need very complicated behavior predicting algorithms, just a basic instantaneous lead calculator. The limited tank reaction time and RNG makes it even easier for modders.
World of Tanks bots are programs that will take control of your account and perform automated tasks. Bots can be quite effective at farming silver and experience and will let you unlock higher-tier tanks a lot faster if used right. Especially at the lower levels of play (low tier battles) bots can be quite effective, since the repair costs are not as high. While the best scripts are pretty proficient at fighting, most automated farming software will use scout and light tanks in order to spot enemies and earn experience and silver that way. But even the scripts that are able to fight will get less effective, as you progress through the tiers. Also bots will require you to either have huge piles of silver or gold, since the silver earned will not always exceed the repair costs and ammo consumption. This is probably the biggest difference between WoT bots and other game bots: WoT bots can actually make you lose money if they are not configured correctly. Bots will generally allow you to skip most of the grind involved in playing WoT is a serious manner. However, configuring them correctly might take some time.

## World of tanks aimbot can be used to cheating in the game.

- I do believe the infamous Warpack cheat collection contains an aimbot. Warpack is not for free, but it has many users. Cheats are pretty good business.
- another one (for free) is Lportii’s aimbot. Yesterday, one player tested that particular one in a training room, it works.
First time I hear of such a thing… I used to play CS 1.6 extensively, and there I could tell after 2 rounds if the enemy player use wall cheat/aimbot or other widespread cheats.
In this game I can tell you if it is a bot or not… but this aimbot crap… come on people… what is the point?
Players using cheats are simply just fooling themselves…
Of course that doesnt change the fact its a cheat and illegal but (thx wargaming for making one good decision with server side calculations) its not as big of a problem as in other games, where an aimbot can basically make u hit(and headshot an enemy) every single time.
Even though aimbots undoubtedly offer you godlike aim and accuracy, it is essential to take precautions if you decide to use them. There is a high chance that your account could get banned if you are caught using them in an online game; therefore, it is crucial to beware of the risks. For instance, several large games have banned hundreds of thousands of accounts for using cheats and cheats, and there is no sign of them stopping. To learn how to reverse, cheat & code properly check out Guided Hacking video tutorials and guides.
However, there are some aimbots that have built-in flaws in order to make the cheating a little less obvious to players who decide to stick around and spectate. They might introduce slower aiming, few intentional misses, or less precise movement and speed. In addition, multiple aimbots have the option of being turned off and on at the player’s will, and this can help make it hard to identify their use.

You can cheat World of Tanks Blitz using a modded APK (Android) or IPA (iOS) file to manipulate cheats within the game. They make it easier to target or auto-aim, improve turret traverse, see past walls, increase your tank’s speed, and other excellent functionalities beyond the game’s scope.
Anyone that has played the game for longer than a few hours, or even considers themselves a pro, knows that knowledge of enemy positions ans tanks is more than half the battle in any Tanks simulator. Enter the WoTB Wallcheat that allows you to see all enemy tanks through walls and any other terrain or map object, see their distance, their type of tank, the ammo they are loading, player name, rating ect. Essentially this kind of cheat allows you to keep track of all enemies on the map and outplay, flank and ambush them without any difficulty. While statistically this cheat is not quite as powerful in farming credits, EXP and gold as an auto aiming app, it is a lot ore fun, as it retains that sense of outplay and achievement that will keep you playing and enjoying PvP in World of Tanks Blitz. Highly recommended cheat and it is a lot more respectful toward other players as well with reduced risk of reports, since it is almost impossible for enemy players to tell if you can see them through walls.
