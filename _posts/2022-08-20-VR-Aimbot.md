## An aimbot is a software program that allows users to shoot other players with bullets without having to aim.

So playing contractors today and low and behold caught my first aimbot user in PvP. It's all downhill from here. Hope the devs will take the necessary steps to deal with aimbot users. Got video of the guy running full speed shooting people and getting headshots. No aiming just the run animation and boom dead.not dropping names but if devs contact me I will give them the users information. Be safe out there and screw aimbot users who have no skill.

Second and more importantly there is no fixed view and no fixed gun sight that you have to use as feedback like in a typical aimbot. In order to use the same aim techniques, the bot would have to control not only both hands but the head as well, moving all 3 tracked objects in unison so that it can use them to aim on the 2D projection of the player view.
Not saying it's impossible but it will likely be an order of magnitude more difficult to build and more game-breaking than 2D aimbots. Imagine "disengaging" the aimbot and resuming normal play only to have all 3 tracked objects snap back to their real world locations. Uncomfortable and likely trivial to detect with anti-cheat software by simply watching for tracked objects teleports.
Cool cheat on A Pavlov VR that you can download for free from our website. This is the only free cheat on this game with Aimbot features - for accurate shooting at enemies, as well as with ESP and Wallcheat features that will show your enemies through walls and other textures on the map. Use, at the moment the cheat is not detected
Nobody is able to Ironsight AWP across the map +70m for a headshot consistently or crouch quick snap turn. Or the more rediculous one - super short players. This isn't the normal "set height to as low as you can go by crouching and calibrating" This is like - the actual player model is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doll size with a normal sized gun, etc running around.

Gun Raiders does not deviate too far from the beaten path when it comes to first-person multiplayer shooters, but it does the basics nicely. On the surface, this might not sound like all that glowing of a recommendation, but that's not the case as there are not all that many free-to-play FPS VR titles out there; consequently, Gun Raiders fills a void.
VRChat has become the premier app for interacting with others over VR, expanding itself even to this day. The limit is the player's imagination, with VRChat offering a ton of freedom. With endless mod support, the player can take on the appearance of just about any fictional character and explore virtually any landscape.
One of the earliest and best VR games to gain mainstream attention, Echo VR is a treat for fans of zero-g, sci-fi competition. Originally known as Echo Arena, Echo VR has since expanded to include Echo Combat as well. However, only Echo Arena is free.
