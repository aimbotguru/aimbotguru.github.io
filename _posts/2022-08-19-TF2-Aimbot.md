## Tf2 aimbot is a cheat that allows players to shoot enemies in the head from a distance.

Aimbot : I’m Pretty sure everyone knows what this is, this cheat automatically aims at players, and it can be customize to target specific hitboxes. This cheat can also be set at a specific FOV (Field of view), If the FOV is set to, for example, max, the cheater can shoot people at every angle. Lower FOVs are subtle and harder to spot.

This is the most commonly used cheat. It uses a system that has priorities in killing players. Sources say that for example sometimes it favours closer enemies or snipers above other players. Aimbot will take control over your aim and flick on the enemies head, with some aimbots with the help of Triggerbots firing. This aimbot can detect you wherever you are. This means that you will probably not get lucky when you try to strike it from behind. Again, aimbot is highly customizable.
there is a new type of bots on tf2 “the extermination bot services”, they’re cheaters but scripted specially to kill other cheaters in any game, they won’t kill you, if you see one of them don’t kick him, they’re friendly with true players, they will help you. pic.twitter.com/M3FSuM4GBu
Depending on skins and characters, an aimbot designed to hit the image of the enemy can still miss or fail to lock. But every character has an underlying structure beneath all the fancy skin. Our Team Fortress 2 cheat makes sure you lock onto the highest damage points on the said skeleton.

This some aimbots into thinking, that your head is on a different place then it really is. It will shoot the disguise head and not your head, often resulting into the aimbot hitting you into the chest, as we can see on the right. The aimbot shoots where it thinks you have your head but, really, your chest is there. Unfortunately, a lot of clients have an updated version that this trick does not work on.
A giveaway of if a sniper cheater is using aimbot is usually when they make a flick that stops exactly on the head. Aimbots are customizable so you can choose which part of the hitbox you want it to aim for. Another way of telling if someone is using aimbot is when the suspect is aiming on someone and he suddenly flicks on someone totally different and shoots. This is caused by the aimbot preferences taking over. Unfortunately, most clients have the option to disable the flicking and make the aimbot just lock onto the player.
[!] Spinbot/Anti-Aim : This cheat is also used by cheaters to counter other cheaters. Spinbot spins the player, cheaters sometimes use this to just show other people that they are blatantly cheating, or it can sometimes be used to counter cheaters. Anti-Aim is a more effective way to counter cheaters, AA (Anti-Aim) creates a fake body, known as a fake angle, this is used to juke other cheater's aimbots, and there are ways to counter fake angles by using resolvers, that resolve the fake angle and determine where the real angle is. TL;DR Most commonly used by cheaters to counter other cheaters. However, is some cases, AA can be used to juke legit players, "Legit-AA" creates a fake angle that faces forward, and makes the real angle face a different direction, away from the fake angle, thus, it forces legit players to hit the fake angle and miss.

## Tf2 aimbot is a cheat that allows players to shoot enemies in the head from a distance with less effort.

No more worries about missing your target and running out of time. That opportune window when you can deal the most damage closes pretty quickly in a competitive environment. Our TF2 aimbot solves that problem and allow you to hit your enemies perfectly, every time. The auto-aim lock is the god of in-game fights. Burst them down effectively in mere milliseconds, before they even know what hit them.
There’s plenty of personalization and configuration scope with our TF2 aimbot and we also have Sniper Rifle options that will help you deal instant headshots or if you prefer, play more legit. But first, let’s cover all the basics.The aimbot is bone-targeted. It means that the bot doesn’t target the image of the enemy. It targets their character rig.
The Team Fortress 2 Aimbot feature is one of the top features that we offer, and it will allow you to pick off your enemies with ease. It’s the most advanced, versatile, and robust aimbot out there on the market right now. Not only does it come with a bunch of foolproof aiming cheats, but using it is also infinitely easier than any other you might have tried or heard about. It also comes with a projectile prediction for Bow, Rocket Launcher and other weapons, which in exchange can also help you dealing lot of insane critical hits to the enemy.
Our aimbot will never miss, and you’ll never have to resort to auto shoot. What’s more, it even has movement prediction built-in. Some systems claim to have “bullet drop prediction”. It only goes on to tell how unreliable they are. TF2 has no bullet drop mechanism. It’s not supposed to be a realistic game like Call of Duty or just a bad one like Fortnite (try sniping on Fortnite, it’s a nightmare!). On top of that, the maps in TF2 are smaller, and so no need to even introduce such a feature for TF2 rifles. That’s why our aim doesn’t need to factor in any sort of bullet drop.
Besides aimbot, triggerbot, ESP, and many visual cues (crosshair, warning systems, hit information, wallcheats, etc.), our TF2 cheat also comes with BadList and FriendList options. Add players you don’t want to cheat on in the friendlier of the two lists. Enemies go into the BadList.
Silent aim has been recently patched so if you try and use it now it will look like this: The cursor will flick towards a head for a tick or two (TF2 uses ticks instead of frames) take a shot and snapback. It can be hard to spot if there is a lot of ♥♥♥♥ happening.
Silent aim hides the snapping caused by aimbots locking onto players on the spectators and cheaters POV. Silent aim makes you flick back after the aimbot made you flick on target. Unfortunately, silent aim still works for projectile and melee weapons.
A cheat with good projectile aimbot is a good cheat. Lmaobox does not have good projectile aimbot, but Nullcore has some next level physics and computer science master’s degree code shit that allow for some insane calculations that make their projectile aimbot so fucking good.
