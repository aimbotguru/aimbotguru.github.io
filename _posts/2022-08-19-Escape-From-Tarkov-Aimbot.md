Choose your passwords carefully. Choose passwords that would be difficult for others to guess and update them regularly. A strong password should include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols. Don’t use the same password for every account/profile, and don’t share your passwords with anyone.
All the Escape from Tarkov cheats we offer come with the necessary features to give you the upper hand in any battle you will face. All our EFT cheats have wallcheat ESP so you can see enemy players, NPCs and all items you need at any time. The aimbot feature will ensure that you will be able to hit any enemy you want without breaking a sweat!
The aimbot in each cheat is there to assist your aiming to make sure it hits the target even when you aim next to the target. By aiming at the right target, if you press the aimkey (usually the right mouse button) you will see the aim snap directly on target and then you can just shoot and you will be assured of a hit!
It goes without saying that EFT is a fast-paced game, which requires around-the-clock attention and instantaneous responses. Sometimes, this may prove to be more than difficult, resulting in frustrating death, losses and checkpoint resets. These Escape from Tarkov Aimbot cheats will see players dominating the gameplay, allowing them to take down any opponent that crosses their path. When the Aimbot cheats are active, the player gets to enjoy seamless takedowns from just about any angle.

EDIT2 / Look @ the idiot who posted his setup in this comment chain. LOOK AT THE SETUP AND THEN THINK ABOUT WHAT I DESCRIBED! It's so fucking easy to do when you have a setup like that, and actually perfect for what I described! I didn't even know he had tall monitors like that, but isn't that EXACTLY how I described it?! He looked top left and bottom left for two different things. Top left was the radar part of his screen, bottom left is chat. If you can't see/understand this, I just don't know..."
Bullshit on those saying you will always end up banned if you cheese, I�m 3 wipes in on a private with aimbot and I still to this day haven�t been banned and I�m cheesing with my EOD account. Just don�t aimbot every player in a lobby and you won�t get banned. Find a UD cheat with less slots. Simple

## Optimal ways to play the game to minimize the chance of getting scammed.

And since you made this post, I'll advise you to be cautious because you are going to get a lot of people offering you their cheats. You will want to make sure they have a lot of Black Market Trades, good vouches, and a long lifetime on their account on elitepvpers. I tell you this because a lot of people have gotten scammed on here, and I don't want you to be one of them. Feel free to reach out on Discord if you have more questions.
Be careful when shopping online. Beware of offers that seem too good to be true, and always use an online shopping service that you know and trust. Think twice before using virtual currencies (like Bitcoin) - they do not have the same protections as other transaction methods, which means you can’t get your money back once you send it. Learn more about online shopping scams.
So far this cheat is REALLY GOOD. God Mode, Teleporting, Invisible on Map, Trigger BotRage Aimbot, and more with the best cheat that is the Roulette Outcome. This will get you Money to blow on anything in the game. Max you can win per 48 minutes (1 GTA day) in the casino is 4.4 Mil. How do I know because i have all the money i could ever want in this game thanks to the Roulette outcome cheat. The first thing you buy is a Penthouse in the Casino. This will get you to High Roller tables and you can bet 55k max on the roulette table. You choose the number for example 5 and put your 5k on that number and then you choose the 2 to 1 Column in this case it's the middle column. You bet 50k on that spot. That will get you 330k per spin. The spins happen roughly every minute on the roulette table. Think about that.... $330k per minute!!!!! They will eventually tell you that you cannot bet anymore once you hit 4.4mil in a GTA day. Wait 48 minutes and do it again. There is also another Casino cheat called Lucky Wheel Result. You can change the value from 0 to 100. Only thing is nobody in the support team could tell me what those numbers mean. Someone from support told me the 100 means with the lucky wheel, you'll win 100% of the time. I was just speechless. I thanked the support person as they had no idea what the numbers meant and decided to figure it out myself. So I spent basically one full day going through every number on the cheat to see the results on the Wheel and found out what each number means. (I will add this to the review at the bottom) This Cheat is well worth the price. The Teleport makes doing jobs, quests, deliveries a piece of cake. The Casino cheats give you unlimited amounts of money. Those are my 2 favorite cheats in this. Some suggestions: 1. Update the Heist planner to Cayo Perico. The casino Heist is a 2 player minimum. Cayo Perico heist can be done solo. 2. Make us stealth to the npcs. 3. A user guide/explanation on what each cheat does. There are still cheats in this thing that I dont even know what it does. Lucky Wheel Numbers are below. Set your value in the cheat and spin the wheel. 100 = Discount 95 = VEHICLE 90 = MYSTERY 85 = 25,000 Chips 80 = 20,000 Chips 75 = 15,000 Chips 70 = 10,000 Chips 65 = $50,000 60 = $40,000 55 = $30,000 50 = $20,000 45 = 15,000 RP 40 = 10000 RP 35 = 7500 RP 30 = 5000 RP 25 = 2500 RP 20 = Clothing 15 = Clothing 10 = Clothing 5 = Clothing 0 = Clothing
Keep your personal details secure. Put a lock on your mailbox and shred your bills and other important documents before throwing them out. Keep your passwords and pin numbers in a safe place. Be very careful about how much personal information you share on social media sites. Scammers can use your information and pictures to create a fake identity or to target you with a scam.
Scams succeed because they look like the real thing and catch you off guard when you’re not expecting it. Scammers are getting smarter and taking advantage of new technology, new products or services and major events to create believable stories that will convince you to give them your money or personal details.
Either way, it's a much bigger problem than people would like to admit. If BSG really wanted to do something about it, they need to shut down the way people make real money which means eliminating the flea market all together until a better solution is found. The only incentives to cheat at that point will be because someone sucks at the game and wants to grieve others or someone want to make a fraction of the money running people through maps (which will lose it's allure once people cannot sell roubles for real money or their profits are cut significantly).
Contact your financial institutionIf you have sent money or shared your banking details with a scammer, contact your financial institution immediately. They may be able to stop a transaction or close your account to protect you from further loss. Your credit card provider may be able to chargeback any fraudulent transactions.
Be alert to the fact that scams exist. When dealing with uninvited contacts from people or businesses, whether it's over the phone, by mail, email, in person or on a social networking site, always consider the possibility that the approach may be a scam. Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.
