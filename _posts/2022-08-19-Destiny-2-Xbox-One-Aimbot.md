Destiny 2, the sequel to 2014’s Destiny, is a multiplayer first person shooter game supported on PS4, Xbox One, and Windows. There are two types of playing environments; Player versus Player (PvP) and Player versus Environment (PvE). In PvP, you can either attack other players in a winner take all fight or compete to achieve objectives. In PvE, there is a storyline to follow, free roaming, strikes, and raiding. In order to advance and upgrade your weapons, you will need to do all of those things quickly.
Bungie's "Destiny 2" is one of the most popular multiplayer games around and the company even has its sights set on Hollywood, hoping to bring the story to the big screen in the future. Unfortunately, the science-fiction shooter has a problem. "Destiny 2" is full of cheaters, and according to reports, it's one of the most cheated games on the market. Cheats in "Destiny 2" can significantly alter gameplay, giving players wallcheats, aimbots, and invincibility. Furthermore, having these game-breaking cheats makes grabbing high-value loot easier, thus devaluing the goods for players that obtained them legitimately. In PvP arenas, it's not surprising that the average player gets frustrated when they match up against a cheater.
In Destiny 2, the last safe city on Earth has fallen and lays in ruins, occupied by a powerful new enemy and his elite army, the Red Legion. Every player creates his own character called a “Guardian,” humanity’s chosen protectors. As a Guardian in Destiny 2, players must master new abilities and weapons to reunite the city’s forces, stand together and fight back to reclaim their home. In Destiny 2 players embark on a fresh story filled with new destinations around our solar system to explore, and an expansive amount of activities to discover. There is something for almost every type of gamer in Destiny 2, including gameplay for solo, cooperative and competitive players set within a vast, evolving and exciting universe. [Bungie]
