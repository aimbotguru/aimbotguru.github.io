## What is shellshock and how does it work?

Recently, our friends at Rapid7, the developers of Metasploit, released a quick and dirty module that exploits one of the first discovered Shellshock vulnerabilities, namely the exploitation of the BASH shell to send CGI scripts to an Apache server. In addition, they also developed a module that enables us to exploit Shellshock using the DHCP service. Let's use that one to attack a Linux system and see how it works.

Shellshock will be with us for quite a while, despite efforts to patch systems, as we are only beginning to understand the extent of this vulnerability. Every time a new patch is released, it almost immediately becomes obsolete as new vulnerabilities are being discovered daily. The first proof of concept involved running a CGI script on the vulnerable system, but that is only scratching the surface of what can be done with this vulnerability.
Every so often, a MAJOR vulnerability appears that makes millions of systems vulnerable to attack. The most recent, named Shellshock, basically leaves every Mac OS X, Linux, and UNIX system on the planet vulnerable. As nearly two-thirds of all web servers on planet Earth run one of these operating systems (primarily Linux), that's a whole lot of systems out there waiting to be harvested.
At its core, Shell Shockers is a multiplayer FPS featuring egg characters. Its gameplay puts you in charge of a violent egg armed with assortment of weapons and the goal is to enter the arena, killing any opponent that stands in your way in order to go up the leaderboard.
Shell Shockers is a free, multiplayer online game based on first-person shooters. Have you ever wondered what playing PUBG as an egg would be like? That’s the whole game! You literally play as an egg against other eggs who you have to shoot and eliminate to win the match.

The Shell Shockers cheats will be downloaded and activated automatically by your script manager (Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey). You may now start decimating the competitors with your newly activated super powers by opening the game in your browser! Don’t get in trouble though!
When you’re using wallcheats, you’ll be able to see enemy eggs through walls, trees, and, other solid objects. This means that an enemy will never be able to sneak up on you for a kill, as you’ll be able to track their movements throughout the match! In the next section, I’ll show you how to download and use these Shell Shockers cheats.
When we do so, we simply get the message "Auxiliary module execution completed." In our case here, this simply means that we were able to run our CMD line using the Shellshock vulnerability to set up a netcat listener with root privileges on port 6996 piping out a BASH shell to whoever chooses to connect to it!
For all you Shell Shocker fans, we’ve got great news! For the time ever, we’ve found one of the best Shell Shockers cheats that actually works. After testing out different scripts from different sites, we were able to shortlist one that gave us everything – Aimbots, Wallcheats, Infinite Ammo, Super Jump, Unlimited Health, and more.

## How to avoid shellshock in your web browser?

I hope this guide has taught you all the different types of Shell Shockers cheats available and how you can activate them. There are hundreds of scripting cheats available online, but not all of them might work correctly. The ones that I’ve mentioned here have been tried and tested by many users, so you can definitely give them a go.
From Aimbot to ESP, there are a plethora of Shell Shockers cheats out there on the web and they are mostly executed using scripts. So if you’re already itching to unlock all skins in the game or even listen to music while playing, then here’s how to cheat shell shockers.
Many network and security admins are now sitting around pretty smug that they have patched their system and they are now safe. That is far from the truth! This vulnerability is linked to the BASH shell and any system calls it makes. That list is extremely long! Probably thousands of utilities and applications use BASH for system calls. Furthermore, nearly all the embedded systems, from security systems to automobiles to automated lighting systems use some form of Linux with a BASH shell. ALL are vulnerable to this cheat.
"The bug is found in Bash's parsing code. There is an error in the way that Bash parses environment variables during its initialization sequence. Anything that can manipulate the environment variables has the potential to be a vector for this vulnerability.
SRVHOST needs to be set to the DHCP server address of your LAN. For consumer environments, the gateway (router) typically operates as a DHCP server as well, so set SRVHOST to the IP of your router. (understanding how the exploit works will make the "why" of this more clear).
